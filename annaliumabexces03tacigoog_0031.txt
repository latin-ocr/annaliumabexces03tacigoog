[18] INTRODUCTION [enar. ιη

ἱηΗιιεηῑίαΙ, 'with the army of Lower Germany, as well as master ol* his
own,¹ was apparently organizing a conspiracy, connived at by perhaps
both the surviving sisters of the Emperor, and supported by Lepidus, his
brother-in-law and kinsman.² It is possible to suppose that this treason
on foot was already known, and that the projected German and British
expeditioris were no more than the alleged object for collecting in Gaul
such an army as would suffice to cow the German legions, and suppress
the danger without bloodshed ⁸3 and that in all the rest we have only
some clumsy attempts to sustain the pretend-⁴
We have also a criticism by Tacitus on the blundering manner in
which GaiuS, suspicions of the eminenoe of M. SilanuS, corrected the
anomaly, previously deemed harmiess‚ by which, in Africa alone among
all the senatorial provinces, the proconsul had command of a legion and
of the auxiliaries attached to it.⁸ His introduction of a dual govern-
ment, by placing the legion with its auxiliaries under a ‘legatus Augusti ’,
styled ‘legate of the army which is in Africa ⁹, whose authority clashed
with that of the proconsul, was fruiti'ul, as might have been expected, in
jealousy and discord ‘3 but the change so far commended itself to his
successors that the old anomaly was never restored, [though as happened in
the case of the legates of the two German armies the ‘legate of the army in
Africa ’ became at a later period ‘ legate of the province of Numidia ’.Ὺ-Ρ]
A single sentence relating to the command of Gaius that his statue
should be set up in the temple at Jerusalem, maybe quoted as so far showing
a difference from Josephus as apparently to represent an outbreak to have
actually commenced.⁸ [In this act of Gaius we should probably see not
merely caprice, but the pursuance of a policy in which he was encouraged
by semi-oriental princelingS, such as Herod, that namely of posing as a
monarch of the Hellenistic type and therefore as god as well as king.—-P.]

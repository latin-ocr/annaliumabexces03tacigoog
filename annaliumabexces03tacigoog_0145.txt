in the selection of its officers. It is doubtless due to the imperfectiori of
our history of this period that so little is known of the previous life of
Aulus Plautius Silvanus, the commander-in-chief‚ who can hardly be
supposed to have owed his advancement in any degree to his relationship
to one of the emperor’s wives.¹ He is called by Dio ‘ a senator os the
highest reputation ’,⁸ is known to have been consul some sourteen years
previously, and at some time legatus of Delmatia,⁸ and must have been
at this time in command of some important province connected with the
expedition.⁴ His capacity may be taken as established by his achieve-
ments; and he was supported by subordinateS, to command whom must
have been in itself no mean honour. Foremost among them stands the
great name os Vespasian, who was then legatus os the Second Legion
after his praetorship‚⁸ and whose distinction in this war was afterwards
regarded as his first ‘designation by fate ' for future eminence.‘ In some
command under him was his elder brother Flavius Sabinus,⁷ better
known as the city praefect of the great year of civil war.⁸ Apparently
in command of another legion was Cn. Hosidius Geta,⁹ already known
as having succeeded to, and carried out to its completion, the daring
strategy of Suetonius Paulinus in Mauretania,¹⁰ and afterwards credited
in this campaign with having once at least snatched a victory out of a
defeat.¹¹ The names of the other ‘legati legionum’ are unfortunately
lost to us; but we find a still more distinguished staff following in the
personal train of Claudius. First among these is another tried soldier
and future emperor, Servius Sulpicius Galba‚¹² another a consular of long
standing, M. Licinius Crassus Frugi, who had already won triumphal
honours sor some previous exploit.¹’ Among others of the same high

⁴ It is possible to su, pose him to have
been successor to P. abinius in Lower
(Dio, 60. 8, 7), or to Galba in Upper
Germany (Suet. Galb. 6) ; but there is no
evidence os his having held either post.
A more natural supposition would make
him to have been legatus os Gallia Bel-
gica, in which the army was got together.

Dio, 60. 30, r, that Titus also accompanied
his father to this war, und on one occasion
saved his life in an encounter‚ has been
copied into many narrative& but is chro-
nologically im 'ble; inasmuch as the
received date of the birth ot* Titus (Suet.
Tib. 2) would make him only two years
old at this time.

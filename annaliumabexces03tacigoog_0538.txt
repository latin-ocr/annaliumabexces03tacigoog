here was first noticed by Jac. Gron., and
the earlier edd. had followed Put. in
reading g‘quae domus ιιι ant’· ,which
might be taken in the same sense by ysup-
plying‘ domni Neronis’, but which seemed

alm' ιιι his last ed. Ritt. takee‘ domui'
to be a gradual corruption of‘ domibnsss
and takes the meaning to be‘ what re-
mained to the houses ’, i. e. the walls and
foundations (which still gives a sense in·
consistent with ‘ erecta ')‚ It should be
noted that throughout this narrative
ὅ domus’ is either used, in the singular,
os the palaee of Nero (e. 39, 13 42, ι)
or, in the plural, of mansionis, as distinct
from ‘insulae' (c- 38, 33 41, 1³43‚3)

and would thus hardly be used here of

dwellingsm ugeneral‚ so as to be followed
by‘ insularum’ below. Hence Heraens,
who otherwise follows Lips.. prop poses the

bold reading‘ quae domus insulaeque

on the subject (Μ. Seneca, Controv. 2. 9).
The limit fixed by Nero would appear to
have exceeded 60 feet. asit was reduced
to that by Trajan (Aur. vict. Epit. 13);
and the heightjm os buildings was excessive
in the time of Juvenal (3, 269) and much
later: cp. ‘Aemula vicinis fastigia con·

ordinibus,

serit astris’ (Claud. de cons. Stil. iii. ι 34),

Ner. 16 ‘formam aedificiorum novam
excogitavit, et ut ante insulas et domos
porticus essent, de quarum solariis in-
cendia arcerentur’. The idea of such
streets of colonnades may have been taken
from those constructed by Antiochus
Epiphanes at Antioeh.

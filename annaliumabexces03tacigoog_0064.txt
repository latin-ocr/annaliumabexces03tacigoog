’ to her for his restoration from an eight years' banishment, and for - his

advancement to the praetorship,¹ might be relied upon to understand
that he was summoned for a double purpose, and was also to lend
all the resources of his versatile intellect to the furtherance of her
schemes?

As to the actual course of instruction, we are told⁸ that the boy
touched all subjects desultorily, that his mother dissuaded him ftom
philosophy as unsuitable to his position,⁴ that his teacher, secking to
enlist his admiration for his own style, discouraged the study of the
great orators of antiquity,⁸ that not only during the most youthsul
period of his rule, but for some years afterwards, his more formal
utterances were all composed for him⁸ ς and the pursuits in which his
energy found scope ⁷ were assuredly not inspired by Seneca, who may
probably have understood that the ulterior purposes indicated above
were the most real end to be served by his presence.

It remains only to note the stages of his advancement. Those who
had overthrown Messalina thought it their interest to supplant Britan·
nicus· ; and anything could be got out of Claudius in his present mood ἐ
so immediately after Agrippina's marriage an address from the sen'ate
procures the betrothal of Octavia to the stepson ¹⁰3 a tale magnified by
Vitellius having previously sufficed to set aside the already affianced
L. Silanus ¹¹: a year later (803, Am. 50), Pallas persuades his patron
with equal facility that the adoption of the already designated semin-law
is recommended by precedent and policy ¹²3 and L. Domitius at twelve

his extant writings, the ⁴ Consolatio ad
Marciam' has been thought to date be·
sore his exile3 the ⁸ Consolationes ad
Helviam’ and ‘ad Polybium ’‚ which
(besides some epigrama) were certainly
written during it, show how readily he
could adapt himself to the mood of
Stoicism or flattery. 11 Dio (1.1.) is to
be believed. he even wrote at this time a

by his youth3 but the same was still the
case five years afterwards (¹4. 11, 4), and

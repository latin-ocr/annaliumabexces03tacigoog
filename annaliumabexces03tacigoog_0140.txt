that his general knowledge on these points is hardly so much in advance
of that os Caesar and Strabo as we should have expected from his date
and his exceptional means of information.

In the Agricola he correctly characterizes the results of the invasions
of Julius Caesar,¹ and refers the long subsequent inaction to the civil “
wat-8, the ‘ politic sorgetsulness ' os Augustus, and the powersul influence
of his ideas on the mind of his successor ²3 an explanation which he would
probably have set forth with more detail in the body of his larger work.

It must be plain that Caesar's professed object in invading Britain⁸
could have been only very imperfectly and temporarily attained by the
successes gained in it; and that, if he really believed the independence of
the island to be a standing menace to the peace os Gaul, he must have
contemplated some permanent occupation of it; and that this scheme,
though thrown into the background by the great expedition to the East,
on which his energies were concentrated at the time of his death, was
among the ideas bequeathed by him to his successors. He had shown that
to land an army in the country and to penetrate its forests was practic-
able, and that the means of dividing its people by intrigue were ready to
hand; that there would be tribes, such as were in his time the Trino-
vantes of Essex,⁴ as ready to invite Roman interference as had been the
Aedui and Remi os Gaul.

By the partition of the empire under the triumvirate, the execution of
the dictator’s ideas in respect of the occupatiori of Britain would fall to
the share of his nephew, who was apparently so far penetrated with the
necessity of sustaining his reputation by an advance in that direction as to
have at least made some show of preparing to invade this country as early
as 720, n-c. 34, when he was recalled from Gaul by the Dalmatian rising.⁸

The idea of this conquest, though again postponed by the imminent
civil war,⁸ is kept prominently before the public mind in the literature
of the years immediately before and after Actium ’ς and the announce-
ment of an expedition for this purpose under the personal command of

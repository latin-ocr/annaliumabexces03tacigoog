form in marriage (⁸ nuptiarum auspices

The part appears to have been uominally
sustained by friends present (Marquardt,
Privatl. i. 48, 1), who would seem to have
had to repeat some formula.

gion. had attempted to approach nearer
to the Med. ‘ exultabero ' by reading ‘ ex-
ultaverit ', and taking that verb as an
equivalent os ἐξορχεῖσθαι, which, besides
its use of the pantomimist's art, is used
also in the sense of insulting or disgracing.
But no trace oi any such meaning appears

8. dignitate formae. This emenda·

ablatives as dependent on ‘ accingi ’ς but
it seems better to take them (with Jacob)
as brachylogieal ablatives of quality; the
real instrumental abl. with the verb being

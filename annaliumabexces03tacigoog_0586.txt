NERONIAN PERSECUTJON oF CHRISTIANS 419

while that of the Christiane is as universally ignored‚¹ and is generally
supposed to have hardly got beyond the stage at which it was reckoned
by Romans merely as a Jewish sect, parted from the main body by what
seemed to be obscure and even unintelligible differences.’

The theories which seek an explanation of these difficulties in
some confusion between Jews and Christiana may be briefly given as
follows 2-

1. It has been conjectured ⁸ that the real victims were zealot Jews,
who had taken a lomi name from Judas of Galilee, and whose existence
had been so forgotten when Tacitus wrote as to cause them to be
consounded with the Γαλιλαῖοι ⁴ proper or Christiana, to whom Tacitus
has appropriated ‘ the sufferings which he might with far greater truth
and justice have attributed to a sect whose odious memory was almost
extinguished'. This opinion, in its original form, has found sew if any
supporters3⁸ but has suggested others to which the same objections are
not applicable.

2. It has been thought⁶ that the blow fen on both bodies, but that the
memory of the Christian sufferers has been alone preserved3 that the
name of ‘Christus' as that of the expected Messiah was no less upon
the lips of Jews than Christiana, and that the turbulent followers of
some false Christ⁷ drew down an attack upon themselves, which extended
itself by their malicious information,⁸ or by want of discrimination in
the judges‚ to all Christ-worshippers as such.

whi th must have had after his
victory, wi l explain the allusion here to
‘ condiciones pacis’. etc.

a. Matios . . . Vedios, rhetorical plu-
rsls (cp. r. ro, 3). C. Matius is also
often mentioned b Cicero, who preserves
a well-known ιυιῖ excellent letter from
him (ad Fam. 11. 28). He is erally
taken to be the same as the‘ . Matius

lustius Crispus (3. 30, 3), and Seianus.

3. num attinuerit, ‘it would be un·

libertos. [i. e. it is useless to talk of
the excessive mfluence acquired by Roman
knights in earlier days, when even his
household freedmen were placed by
Claudius on a level with himself and the
lsws. The reference is to the all-powerful
freedmen, Narcissus, Callistus, and Pallas,
cp. infra ¹3· 14 (of Pallas) ‘ cura rerum
quis a Claudio impositus velut arbitrium
regni agebat’—P.j

4. rei familiari. It is noted by Hirsch-
feld (Unters. 4) that this term (cp. 4. 15, 33
attatei} ‘35:5062-‘2' 2435? ⁰¹²2ss
be earlier ex’pressions than, ‘ fiscus ‘eptehgigh
the latter term is used by Tacitus in

speaking of the time of Tiberius (see

Α Introd. p. 28, 4).

5. Cois. On the island of Cous see
2. 75, s, and note; on its temple of
Asklepios see 4. 14, 1, and note.

Coeum. The legend at Coeus, one
of the Titans (sons of Uranus and Gaea),
was father of Leto (latona) by his sister
Phoebe, is given in Hes. Th . 404-406.

of physician priests here and at other

great writer Hippocrates.

9. nomina . . . merens. This paren-
thetical participial clause, depending on
so distant a verb as ⁸ memoravit', has
here the unusual adjunct of a dependent
sentence 'in oratio obliqua (⁴ et . . . vi·

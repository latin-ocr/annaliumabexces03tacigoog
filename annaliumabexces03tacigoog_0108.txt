ἱ enar. nn RULE OF NERO [95]

the announcement of murders already perpetrated by decreeing such
public thanksgivings as had been usual alter signal victories.¹ To
complete bis demoralization, such men as Tigellinus accustomed them·
salves to practise sor their own ends upon his fearn,² as others had
practised on thooe of Claudius ; and the timidity so characteristic of him
at all stages of his career⁸ becomes in the last crisis of his life a state
of abject terror, in which he is powerless to act for himself, and is left by
the deser-tion of his advisers to his miserable end.

Those i1'1 the higher ranks who had thus helped to make him what
he was hastened to pass sentence of deposition and death, to wreak their
vengeance on his memory and name, and to make illusory displays of
freedom3⁴ while the numbers who had lived on his bounty to his and
their disgrace deplored a patron whose like they could never hope again
to find! Those of them who believed in the news of his death, and
continued long to deck his grave with flowers,⁸ were important enough
to make Otho and Vitellius seek their favour by paying respect to his
memor-y :⁷ many on the other hand took advantage of the mystery
moending his end to keep up the belief that he yet lived and would
return to execute vengeance and resume his rule.⁸ The strength of
such a belief is shown by the support given to pretenders», not only soon
after his death,⁹ but even some twenty years later3 ²⁰ ancl by the long·
continued Christian expectation of the reappearanee of the arch-tyrant
and persecutor as the coming Antichrist.¹¹

that what was forbidden was a bargain
beforehand. Pliny mentions (Ep. 5. 9,
4) a senatusconsultum enforoed in his
’ time, whereby litigants were forced to
swear before the case came on ‘ nihil se
ob advocationem cuiquam dedisse pro·.
misisse cavisse ’ς adding that after the
trial they were rmitted ‘ pecuniam dum-
taxat decem ' ium dare ⁹. Such adecree
would seem however to have been more
or less a dead letter ; the account in Pliny
shows that its enforeement was so un·
expected as to cause surprise and con-
sternation3 Quintilian, who, while treat-
ing the aceeptance of a present by advo·
entes as an open question, condemns
bargaining as a ‘piraticus mos’ (12. 7,
ιι), attests by that expression its pre-
valenoe; Martial mentions an orator who
demanded 200 sestertia (8. 16, ο), and
himself made bargains beforehand (Id.
17, 1); enormous fortunes were made by
men like Eprius Marcellus and Vibius
· Crispus (see Dial. 8, 2, and Friedl. i.
²31)· See the notes os Nipp. and Dr.

The addition of ‘ quidem ’ in Med. seems
an error of some one who mistook the
soree of ‘ne’. Domitian is stated (Suet.
Dom. 4) to have reimposed this obliga·
tion ; which perhaps was never altogether
done away with, as Lucan, who must
have been quaestor some years after this
decree, is said by his anonymous bio-
gra her to have given a show with his
coi eagues ‘ ut mos erat ⁹.

1. quod quidem. This relates espe-
cially to the latter decree (the former
havin been rather extended than re·
verseg : it would appear, from the con·
text, that what was reeented in ιι. 23,
3, as originating in t e ‘sententia' of a
senator, was enacted, not a senatus-
consultum, but by an edict o Claudius.

edd. read ‘abditis’ with Gron. or ‘ob-

a new door was made at the back of the
building, probably behind the emperor’s
seat. She would thus face the senatore,
and hear all that they said, while the
curtain conceaied her from them. She is
represented, in 14. 11, a, as having tried
to mter the senate itself, which even
Livia had never dated to do (Dio, 57. ιι,
3). Elagabalusis noted (vit. 4, 1 ς 12, 3)
as having even bro ht his grandmother
into theisenate, and lowed her to sit and
vote in t.

5. auditu-3 so most edd. after Lips.
for Med. ‘ aditus ⁹. It is to be noted that
the one word is taken iu au active, the
other in a 've sense (she was to hear
without bessg seen), aud that a plural is
combined with a singulus nor is any
clear instance found where a plural ‘ au·
ditus' is thus used. Heraeus would read
‘ visus. . . auditum’ (the yision being that of
ffffffiffiffiffifffffiffiffx ,ἳξῗῖἰὶέ
‘ visus' (plural) is used of one person in
c. 16, 53 ιι. 34, 3: and many other
plurals for singulars (cp. ‘aemulatus’ c.
46, 5); and that the interchange of plural
and singular may be a mere variation,

like · am vel infamias ’ where again
‚¹¹⁶⁸ would read ‘ poenas infamiam ⁹)

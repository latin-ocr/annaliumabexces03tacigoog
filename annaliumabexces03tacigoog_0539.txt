‘ sine trabibus' shows this to mesu that
the lower stories were to be vaulted in

3. custodes. Ni p. rightly argues
that to make this epend on ‘quisque
haberet' is contrary to sense: and to
supply ‘ essent ’ or ‘ constituerentur ' (with
‘ custodes’ as subject) from ‘haberet’
would be a a of extreme harshness.
The force os ‘ destinabat ' extends over
the whole passage, but its construction
with the accus. (as Nipp. here takes it)
has been dropped ever since the first
sentence. It appears necessary unless we
are to take this ss sn extremely strong in-
stance os the Tacitesn omission of the verb
‘ esse'(1ntrod. i. v. 5 39)‚to suppose, with
Madvig (Λᾶν. iii. p. 236), that ‘essent’
has dropped ont after ‘custodes '. Orelli
supposes the persons here mentioued to

tions as slaves employed ss ⁸ castellari?

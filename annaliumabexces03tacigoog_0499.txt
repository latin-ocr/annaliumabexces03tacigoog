it. Tiberius had recognized the right of
the proconsul of Africa to confer such a
distinction on legionary soldiers under
his command (3. 21, 4) 3 bnt no proconsul

e has been much commented upon
by editors, and is also the subject of a
dissertation by Joh. Miiller (Beitr. iv. pp.
ἱηιξ-38). Halm and several recent edd.
ve followed Lips. in reading ‘ aspicere·
tnr' sor the Med. ‘ apisceretur ’, so as to
get rid of the absurdity of supposing that
the preserved as well as the preservers
were to win the crown; but the meaning
yielded is still far from being altogether
satisfactory. The general sense may be
taken to be ⁴ is the civic crown is given
to a single soldier by the emperor's own
hand as a most glorions honour, how
unnch greater must be the glory where a
whole army can be pointed to, as havin
saved a number equal to themselvesg.
‘Numerus' can certainly (as Jacob sng-

that there may be no deeper error than
that of a sacrifice of clearness to brevity
and to a rhetorical mode oi expression
in which the ‘verba magnifica· of Cor-
bulo himseli' (13. 8, 4) seem to be closely
followed. The chief alternative is that
proposed by Nipp„ who reads ⁸ ubi pet
eornm nnmerum obrueretnr’, and explains
it to mean ‘how much greater is the
glory (than that of the civic crown to a
single soldier) where individnal distinc-
tion would be effaced (so ‘obruere’ in
Agr. 17, 3; Dial. 38, 2) by the number
of preservers and preserved ’. Here the
difficultyin the use os ‘et’ is removed,
but the alteration is violent, and the sense
given to the whole passage is still straincd
and unsatisfactory.

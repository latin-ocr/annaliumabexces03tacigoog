NERONIAN PERSECUTION OF CHRISTIANS 417

Christian forgery, but on grounds slender in themselves,¹ and involving,
as the objector himself seeS, a similar attack on the other passages
in classica! authors of this period! It may be sufficient to point out
that Sulpicius Severus, who has transcribed words of Tacitus in an un·
questioned passage (c. 37, 8), has also transcribed a portion of this (see
on ξ 3); also that the style is thoroughly Tacitean throughout, containing
a number of words and expressions elsewhere used by the author, and
more or less characteristic of him, yet without any such elaborate over-
imitation as we should expect to detect in even a skilful forgery.⁸
Nor is the subject-matter less characteristic, if we note the struggle
between the extreme bitterness and animosity of the general view, and
the sense of candour and historical fidelity in dealing with the actual
charge against the sufferers, the grudging and hardly acknowledged
sympathy, the many unexplained difficulties to which his evident un-
willingness to dwell longer on the subject than he can help gives rise.
It must seem strange that any one who has studied the interpolated
passage in Josephus,⁴ or the correspondence of St. Paul and Seneca,⁸
should suppose that it is only a similar, but somewhat more skilsul
performance of the same kind that lies here before us.

The genuineness of· the passage being assumed, we may add that only
in one or two places does the Medicean text appear to be corrupt.⁸
It would seem also that we are here in possession of all that Tacitus
has thought fit (at least in the Annals) to tell us concerning the
Christiane as such; the mode of reference to the subject here being
such as strongly to make against the supposition that the lost Fifth
Book would have given us in its proper place any fuller account of the

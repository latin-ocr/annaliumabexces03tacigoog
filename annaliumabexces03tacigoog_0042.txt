department of ⁸ accounts ' (‘ a rationibus ⁸) and by the freedman ¹ in charge
of it. Under Claudius the ‘libertus a rationibus ' is clearly a high finan·
3131 authority. It is not clear that he actually received any moneys or
made any payments3 he was rather an mountain-general with a staff of
clerks,² through whose books 311 Caesar's receipts and payments passed,
including any dealings, 3. g. by way of loan, with the public treasury of the
Roman people. That such a department should be merely a private depart-
ment of Caesar's household, 3ηά its head a half-servile domestic, was an
undoubted anomaly which Claudius tried to lessen in two ways. It was
apparently he who made the rule that no private citizen might have a freed-
man bearing the title ‘ 3 rationibus ’, and he certainly granted the insignia
of a public magistracy (the praetorship) to the holder of the office, Pallas.

Two other measures of Claudius suggest the same policy. One is the
grant of magisteria] jurisdiction to his procurators in fiscal cases⁸3 the
other the substitution of imperial procurators sor quaestors, in the super-
intendence of the cornships at Ostia, 3ηά ιιι the management of the domain
lands both m Cisalpine Gaul and ιιι S. Italy.

In foreign affairs the most pressing question was that of the Jewish
1303, both ιιι their own 13ηά 3ηά elsewhere. In Judaea‚ J‘ealous at all
times of even the ordinary incidents of Roman sovereignty,⁴ the de-
sperate struggle provoked by the command of Gaius to erect his statue
in³ the temple had indeed collapsed together with its cause ’ς but
the recollection of the intended outrage survived, reoelling dangerous
memories of Antiochus Epiphanes 3ηά the Maccabees, and ready on any
pretext to burst into a flamm· By withdrawing the insignia of Roman rule
from the country, and placing Agrippa over the whole dominion which
his grandfather had held under Augustus,⁷ the double end was gained of
rewarding a valuable ally, and of securing the temporary tranquillity of
the country, under the rule of one who, though personally dissolute and
worthless‚ had the popularity ⁸ which a native prince alone could wiu.

The Jews of the ⁴ Diaspora ’ were dealt with by two edicts in similar
terms, the oue relating to those of Alexandria, the other to those of the
empire generally, · in both of which the exceptional privileges allowed

'Pallas (333 11. 39, 1, and note) had. and after itanu ιιι-333103 the lawl'ulness of

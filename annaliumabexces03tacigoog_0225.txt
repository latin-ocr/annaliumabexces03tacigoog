with the neighbouring Lugdunum, and
its narrow escape from being destroyed
by the Vitellian forces, see H. 1. 65-66.
On the date of its full establishment as a
Roman colony see below (ou l. 15). The
senators of long standing here alluded to

had received the ‘civitas' individually, as
had been the case with that of Valerius
Asiaticus (see l. 15). .

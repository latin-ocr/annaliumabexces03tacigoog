ἃ 1. expressa, ‘extorted’z cp. 1. 19, 5,
c.

2. malitia . . . crudelitas. The latter
of these is clearly that of the governor,
as ‘laus falsa’ is that of the subjects. It
seems best to take ‘ malitla’ also of the
523ffi02153⁹a1333231⁴2303fflffi2fflffi
the subject as the cause of false accusa-
tions.

as a deponent bg· Quint. and Seu„ and in
the gerund by iv. (3. 18, 3) and others,
also in the act. by Ov., &c., and (in a
different sense) in Plaut. That the desire
to win favour with the subjects, to set
against possible complaints, was a fre·
quent motive to crime, is shown by the
cases of Pilate‚ Herod Agrippa (Acts 12,
2), Felix (Id. 24, 27), Festus (Id. 25, 9).

6. inclinat, ⁸ declines’: cp. ‘si fortuna
belli inclinat ’=(Liv. 3. 61, 5): so, passively,
‘inclinata fortuna’ (Cic. ad F am. 2. 16,1),
and, actively, ‘ inclinasse eloquentiam
dicitur’ (Quint. 10. 1, 80).
⁸ wiihffsstbffiffimiffissd ἓοοιῗῖῑὲἒῗιῗγηῗέ
the sentence is imitated from Sall. Cat..
2, 3 (‘ aequabilius atque constantius sese
res humanae haberent ‘). For this sense
of ‘ aequabilis’ see 4. 2ο, 4, and note.

8. repetundarum, shortened sor
‘ quaestionis repetundarum ’. Nipp. com-
pares ‘ maiestatem ’ (for ‘ crimen maiesta-
tis') in H. 1. 77, 6.

conamini-3} so I'ialm, Nipp., and
others after Lips.‚ as suitable to describe
the effect of a law not yet enacted. The

Med. ‘cohibetur’ cau be retained by
taking the maxim as a general truth.

11. perfici. The same term isnsed of
the formal ratification of a senatus con-
sultum in 14. 49, 2.

abnuentibus . . . relatum, se. ‘we'
(cp. 3. 34, 1): ‘abnuere’ has the foroe
of ‘negare’ in 2. 78, 33 H. 1. 1, 4, δια..

nem' (s’ee 2. 33, 2; 3 , 3), might ask
the consuls to bring the matter foi-mally
before the house (13. 49, 2); but this
tested with their discretiori: and they
would naturally delay action till the
pleasure of the princeps was known (see
13. 26, 2), especially as the question was

12. sanxere nequis, διο. Augustus
had enactedinam. 11,that the subject:
should decree no honour to a gover-
aster his retirement
(Dio, 56. 25, 6). The custom of voting
such honours under the Republic may
be gathered from Cicero (e. g. Verr.
2. 2, 5, 13;adFarn. 3. 8, 33 and many
other passages cited in Marquaxdt,
Staatsv. i. 371, ι), and it does not appear
that either the dect-ee of Augustus or the
present one were able to stop the practice
afterwards3 see Plin. Pan. 7ος Vit- Al.

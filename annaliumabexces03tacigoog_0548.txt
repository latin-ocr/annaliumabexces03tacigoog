in a panegyric on him of 261 lines (see
Biihrens, Poet. Lat. Min. i. azo-2 36),
which has been assigned to Saleius Bassus
and other authors, and with more proba-
bility to Cal urnius, whose name would

Orelli and N lpp. place the comma aster

Tacitus may have written ⁴ i otos’, but

7. levitati: so most cdd. after Em. for
the Med. ‘lenitati ‘, which could hardly
be used otherwise than in a good sense;

subsequent edd. from the other places in
which the name occurs (c. 58, ἔς 67, 1,

Σούβιος (or Σούβριος) Φλαούιος is read.

name is Ἀπρος (or Ἀσπρος) in Dio (1. c.).

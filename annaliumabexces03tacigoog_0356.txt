3. ius praeripere. This decree does
not appear to do away with the ancient
‘ius appellationis’ against the decree of
ι magistrate, which evidently (see Plin.
Ε . 1. 23, 3) still continued to belong to

bunes. The word ‘ praeripere ² seems
rather to point to some stretch of au-
thority by which they were in the habit of
intervenlng in an impending ’suit before
praetore or consuls, and transferring its
gutur? ,ᾗ ‘iudam 2¹:³5⁰}ss

4. vocure ex Itone. The most plau·
sible explanation of this difficult passage
is thut su ested by Mt. Greenidge
(Roman Pub ’c Life, A pend. 2, p. 447)
and adopted by Mr. l-Yenderson (Nem,

. 87). ‘ The tribunes were prohibited

m summoning litigante from sn Italian
town in ceses where ι civil action st law
would heve been possible in that town?
The change now made ‘ clearly took stom
the tribune the final decisiou as to when
ο, civil ense should be summoned from ο,
municipel town to Rome’, the urban
praetor or consul being pomibly declsred
competent to decide the point and ex·
empted from tribunieian interference.—P.]

5. 1.. Piso, mentioned again iu c. 31,

1315. 18, 4. He is taken to be sou

of the consul of Aa). 27 (4. 62, 1), sud
robably the L. Piso, pontifex, who was
usbend of Licinis Magna, dau hter of
the other consul of that year (C. . L. vi.

mentioued as one of t e Arvales from
213· 3⁸7⁶ss5& {qm mirati&
(Front. Aq. 102). If he is the person
who was still alive within Pliny⁰s memory
(Ep. 3. 7, 12), he was father of the pro-
consul ofAfries of mn. o(see H.4. 38‚2 ,
with whom Borghesi (ἄση. iv. 534, 533)
identifies him.

ne quid, δια, ‘thet they should in·
flict uo penalty ( . a. 3², 5, and note)
officially within ‘their houses.’ Nipp.
takes this to mean that in rivate offences
committed by members o the household
they should have no more power then
any other paterfamilias3 but this seems
to have been the general rule sor ull
magistrates. It appears to revive sn old
restrictiou of this power, namely, that
although the tribuue's house was o n
night and day to those who des· to
invoke his ‘auxilium' (Plut. Q. R. 81),
the actual interventiou had to be exercised
in public, usually by the ‘ collegium ’
sitting together (cp. ‘ sd subsellia tribu-
norum res agebatur' Liv. 4²· 33, ι);
their usual plsoe of semion bein at the
‘ rostre' (Gell. l. l.) or in the ‘ silica
Porcia’ (mut. Cat. Min. 3). See Momms.

large powers of fining exercised by tri·
buues under the Republic cannot have
survived st this date. The registratiou
at the aerarium is similar to that of sens·
torial decrees (3. 51, 3), and had to take
place before sentence could be euforced.

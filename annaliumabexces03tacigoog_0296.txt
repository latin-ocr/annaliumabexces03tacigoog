troubles set down by Tacitus to the joint
government. He makes Felix not sent
out until Cumanus was recalled and
hanished in Α.[). 5² (πο. 7, ι), and re-
lates no actions by him as vernor till
the time of Nero. Dean ilman, and
other writers on Jewish history, have
generally followed the authority of Jo-
sephus‚ who should certainly have been
the better informed as to events which
took place when he was fifteen years old
and living at Jerusalem. His account is
further confirmed by the fact that we have
no record at other times of any such
division of this province between two
Roman gova-nors, but alwa of a single
procurator, residing at sesama,

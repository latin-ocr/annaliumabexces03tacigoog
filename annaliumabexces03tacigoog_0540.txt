comparative coolness of the narrow streets

favour (cp. ‘ deum placamentis ' below).
Most edd. (except Walther and Ru etti)
have followed this correction of ff. F.
Grou. for the Med. ‘a dus'; which,
though standin well in antithesis to
‘ humanis consi 'is’, would require the

5. Vulcano, διο. The first of ,these
was, of course, pro itiated as the fite-god.
The temple of eres and Proserpina

propitiata. This verb is used also
in Dial. 9, 5, and appears to have
been adopted by Val. Max. and sub-
srelquent prose writers, from old poeta, as

whence lustral water was brought, to wash

case of goddesses to the ‘ lectisternia ‘ in
honour of gods; the distinction being
founded on the Roman custom, by which
women sat on ⁴ sellae ³ at dinner, while
men reclined on couches. According to
Val. Max. (2. 1, 2), the custom of women

(παννυχίδες) were an ancient custom in
Greece, but apparently a late intro-

the Empire (Plin. N. H. 18. 12, 32, 124;
Suet. Cal. 543 Galb. 43 Vit. 1o, δια).

others as giving licence to immorality3

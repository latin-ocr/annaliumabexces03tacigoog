quam Gorgonei delapsa est pinna caballi ’,
alluding to a famous school os philosophy
and learning at Tarsus on the Cydnus,
mentioned by Strabo (14. 5, 13, 673) as
in his day s assing even Athens and
Alexandria, an known as having pro-
duced several eminent persons whom he
mentions, especially Athenodorus the
teacher of Au stus. Apollonius os Tyana
also studied ere (Philostr. 1. 7, 1).

read ‘ et exerciti , whence Ritt. reads ‘ et

where he thinks that some such word
as ‘ ornatus’ has been lost. Cp. ‘ Graeca

and ‘ libido’).

5. trandibus involutos. The contrast
to ‘ specie bonarum artium salsos ' shows
that these words do not denote hypo-
critical disguise, but a character ‘thorough-
ly elothed in treachery’, i. e. so wholly
perfidions as to wear its character on the
snrface. So the ‘flagitiis commaculati'
are those whose infamous lives are
notorious.

6. bonai-nm uuum, probably to be
taken here of his philosophical acquire-
ments, as in 3. 7ο, 4, of juristic scieuce.

More commonly the expression denotes

‘ specie ’ may be repeat in thought;
ot erwise ‘amicitiae fallax’ will be a
solitar-y instance of a construction ana·
logous to the genitives with ‘ pervicax’,

Cassii asclepiodoti. Dio (62. 26,

was a native os Nicaea (c . ‘praeci nus
inter Bithynos ')‚ and that his exile, rom
which he returned under Galba, was in—

Soranus.

ιο. aequitate deum. The abl. is
generally taken as causal (‘ since the gods
were indifferent to examples os good and
evil '); the deities being assumed to have
caused what they had not overruled.
Ritt. inserts ‘ '’ after ‘deum ’‚ and
makes the abl. absolute; and others, as
Ruperti, so take it as it stands. Dr. notes
the similar sense of ‘aequitas' in Cic. in

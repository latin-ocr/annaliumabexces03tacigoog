[110] INTRODUCTION [CHAP. lv

throughout the whole history of the war he has selected such incidents
alone for prominence as concern Corbulo personally, and has frequently
sacrificed the general narrative of events to biographical particulam.

What has been said above will serve to explain the necessity of here
supplementing the narrative os Tacitus by such a geographical and
chronological sketch as will make it intelligible.

It may be sufficient for the former purpose to trace the three chief
mountain systems forming the highlands of Armenia and the river basius
and plains of various elevation enclosed by them.¹ The central and
highest range, that of the Dujik mountainS, a prolongation of the Anti-
Taurus, parts at its western extremity the two branches of the Upper
Euphrates, the Murad and the Jephrat or Rara-Su3 and is prolonged
under the names of Dujik Dagh, Binghol Dagh, and others, rising at
its eastern extremity to the two highest points in the whole country,
those of Great and Little Ararat; at the soot os the latter of which the
basin of the Erasch (Araxes) is j0ined to that of its tributary the Balyk.
The southern range, treated as a prolongation of Taurus, or Taurus
NiphateS, parts the basin of the Murad from that of the Upper Tigris⁸
under the name os Mush Dagh, and divides at the great plain of Lake Van
into the Arjerosch and Erdoz Dagh south of the lake, and Jebel Nimrud
and Sapan Dagh at the north os it, rising further to the north-east to the
Ala Dagh,⁸ in which the Murad and Balyk find their source and water-
shed. The northern range, enclosing the whole country in its sweep,
divides in its western portion the basin of the Rara-Su from that of the
Ioruk (Akampsis), and in its eastern that of the Araxes from that of the
Kur (Cyrus); the watershed of the Kara-Su and Araxes being found on
the high table-landS, the highest in the whole country and near 7000 feet

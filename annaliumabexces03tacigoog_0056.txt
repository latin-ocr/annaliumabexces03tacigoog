ew. ιιι] RULE oF CLAUDIUS [43]

have we the means of criticizing the unanimous testimony which has
covered her name with infamy.

The guilty wife is no sooner in her grave than her successor comes to
the front, and supplies a dominant influence for the remainder of this mle.
By her hnoege, higher than that of even Messalina or Claudius,¹ she
would bring as her dower an accession of strength even to a prince3 and
few women had learnt so much from the schooling of vicissitudes. In
her thirteenth year she had been passively given in marriage ¹ to one
whose character was said to be as detestable ⁸ as his rank was exalted;
at her widowhood, in her twenty-fifth year, she is found ‘prostituting
herself to Lepidus in the hope of empire'‚⁴ sent into exile, stripped of
property, separated from her two-years' old son. Restored to position
at her uncle's accession‚⁸ and further enriched by a Subsequent marriage
and widowhood,' she begins a new career of ambition, binding the
wealthiest freedman to her interest by unscrupulous profligacy‚⁷ and
winning sor her son a prominence which had nearly eost their lives.⁸

In causing the sall of her rival she may probably have taken no part 3 ⁹
but in the intrigue of which the palace again becomes the focus she
throws her own blandishments into the scale; ¹⁰ and, if we are to believe
our authorities, the incestuous marriage was won by previous incest.¹¹ .

Nor was she to be satisfied with the position of an em'peror's wife 3
she would be all, and more than all, that Livia had been to Augustus,
and govern the Roman world under the shadow of a feeble husband or a
stripling son. In the words of TacituS,¹² ‘ all power centred in a woman 3
but the reins os bondage were now drawn with a firm ‚and masculine
hand: there was all outward show of decorum, and often dignity‚ and
such immorality alone as served her interests ⁹ 3 and the domestic history
of the remaining years is little more than a record of the stages by which

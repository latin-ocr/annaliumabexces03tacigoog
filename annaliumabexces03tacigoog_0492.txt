alii, etc. On these two versions, and
the confirmation of the latter by the actual
facts mentioned, see Introd. p. 116. It is
remarkable that Tacitus does not cite the
authority of Corbulo himself on either
side, and it would appear as if he had
described the transaction in some am-
biguous terms which his admirers and
enemies interpreted differently. We
should guther that Armenia was to be

left neutral during the reference to Rome
(c. 5, 53 7, 1). It is strange that Tacitus
has not cared to mention what afterwards
became of Tigranes, who is only known
from other sources to have left a son
Alexander, who, according to Josephus
(Ant. 18. 5, 4), married Iotape, daughter
of Antiochus of Co e (see on 12.

11. hibernavisse. We are to gather
from this that the compact had been
made just before winter, and that the
Roman army, which was to have wintered
at Tigranocerta, was hastily withdrawn to
such quarters as it could find in Cappa·
docia. The winter ean hardly be any
other than that of 814-815, ΑΛ). 61-62
(see Introd. p. 115, ro); and those who
make that the winter referred to in c. 7,
4; 8, 33 10, 3, give no satisfactory ex-
planation of this passage, which must
express the commenta made in the fol·
lowing spring on the winter already past.

12. retenti, the correction in Med. by
the same hand of the original text
‘ contenti '. Ritt. thinks such a term would
be used rather of Tigranes than of the
Romans, and reads ⁴ obtenti'3 but cp.
‘retinendae Armeniae' (13. 8, 1).

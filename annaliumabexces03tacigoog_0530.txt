3. incertum. We owe it to Tacitus
that any doubt is left on the subject.
Suet. (Ner. 38) and Dio (62. 16, 1) follow
unhesitatingly those authors who charged
Nero with the crime; the former sup os-
ing that he desired the glory of rebuild'ing
Rome with grandeur, the latter, that he
desired to realize the spectacle which
Priam had witnessed. Pliny also (N. H.

similar view is taken by the author οἱ the
‘ Octavia' (831-833), and is followed by
Orosius (7, 7); while Sulp. Severus (see

Plaut. (Amph. Prol. 1‚&c.) and Turpilius

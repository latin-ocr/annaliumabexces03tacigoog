per inlusis· matris, ‘ through the
iniquities of his mother) The context
seems in favour of thus giving ‘ iniurias’
a subjective reference (as in 2. 54, 2, &c.),
rather thau an objective (⁸ by a course οἱ
insults against bis mother') as in e. 19,

loss οἰ a syllable is a common error in
this MS„ and ⁸ debilis ' would mean
‘ crippled ' (as in Verg. Aen. 5. 271, &c.)‚
and would be explained by ‘ trunca manu '.
Others suppose 2. confusion of ‘ b’ and
‘v’ (also common in Med), and read
(with MS. Agr.) ‘ inde vilis’‚ and refer the
word to the stigma of low origin resting
on him, as that of exile rested on Seneca.
But he is not known to have been os
lower origin than any other Roman
knight, [and the suggested identification
with the secretary ⁴ ab epistulis Graecis ',

the reading be ‘ vilis' or ⁴ debilis', Agrip·

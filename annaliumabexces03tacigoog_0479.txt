words in Tacitus may have been ‘duo et

its first letters by confusion with the
three last οἱ ‘ puella ’. Such a reading as
‘quinto et vicesimo’, as suggested by Ritt..
would seem more in aocordauee with her
supposed real age, but less easy to recon-
cile with the text. Similar errors οἱ Tacims
or his copyists are noted in υ. 25, 3, dte.

the simple abl. neven though it is not
unsrequent in Livy (6. 24, 8, &c.). The
meaning is that this exile, so osten the

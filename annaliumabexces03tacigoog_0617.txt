exitii querens ita scripsisset, se quidem mori nullis supplicii
causis, Rufrium autem Crispinum et Anicium Cerialem vita frui
infensos principi.- quae composita credebantur de Crispino, quia 8
interfectus erat, de Ceriale, ut interficeretur. neque enim multo

5 post vim sibi attulit, minore quam ceteri miseratione, quia prodi·
tam G. Caesari coniurationem ab eo meminerant.

18. De C. Petronio pauca supra repetenda sunt. nam illi diesl
per somnum, nox officiis et oblectamentis vitae transigebatur;
utque alios industria, ita hunc ignavia ad samam protulerat,

ιο habebaturque non ganeo et profligator, ut'plerique sua haurien-
tium, sed erudito luxu. ac dicta factaque eius quanto solutiora!

3. composita, ‘to have been invented' his arguments given in Merinle, ch. 53),
(cp. 11. 27, 2; 15. 16, 3, See). It seems and is fully accepted by Buecheler in his
best to suppose this to mean that this edition of that work (Berl. 1862), and by
addition to the will was believed to have Teuffel (History os Roman literature, ¹

been a forgery instigated by Nero, to
justify the one death and to bring about
the other. Nipp. takes them to mean
that Mela was believed to have inserted
the words to bring about the death of
CerialiS, disguising his rsonal animo·
sity towards him by a ding the name
of Crispinus, whom he knew, but was not
supposed to know, to have been already

the words had been really written by
Mela.

5. proditam G. Caesari coniura-
tionem. This appears not to have been
that os Gaetulicus and Lepidus (see In-
trod. p. 8), but one in A.D. 40. Our
only informant, Zonaras (ι 1. 6, p. 557),
states that Nicins Cerialius (so read in
most texts) and his son Sextus Papinius
were arrested and tortured, without dis·
closing, and that the latter afterwards
turned informer. The words of Tacitus
here would make inst the correctness
of this version, whic is also invalidated
by another account (Seu. de Ira 3. 18, 3)
in which Papinius is called ‘consularis
filius’, and said to have been tortured only
sor caprice (¹ animi causa'), not ln any
judicial process.

as in itsel wrong (see on c. 17, ι) and as
having possibly arisen from repeating the
preceding ‘e'. The identification of the

rson mentioned with the author of the
amous Satire is generally considered to
have been proved by Studer (Rhea. Mus.
ii 50, soll. and 202: cp. an absh-act of

300, ⁴)· Professor W. Rammy, who lus
fullydiscussed thesubject (Diet. osBi .)‚
inclines to the o posite view. No u-
sion to the wor can be discovered in
what is said in c. 19‚ 5, and it is rernark-
able that Tacitus gives him no credit lut
any literar-y talent.

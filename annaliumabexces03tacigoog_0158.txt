:· cmm. v] CONQUEST OF BRJTAJN [145]

at Isca Silurum, and that he had intended to collect his troops at
Viroconium.¹ But the officer in charge os the Second legion, pleading
perhaps the necessity of holding down the Silures, disobeyed his sum-
mons; the remainder of the Twentieth could hardly, as it would seem,
bc withdrawn without leaving Deva at the mercy of the Brigantes3 the
Ninth had already marched on and met its fate. So that the F ourteenth
and part of the Twentieth legion, with auxiliaries making up the total to
about ro,ooo men, were the sole soree with which he had to face the
enemy and reconquer the province. At the head of his light auxiliary
troops he moved rapidly along the Watling Street, leaving the more
lowly moving legions to follow. He reached Londinium,¹ but finding

¹ himself too weak to hold it, fell back along the road by which he had

come. Londinium was sacked and Verulamium shared its fate. From
seventy to eighty thousand Roman citizens are computed to have
perished. At some point further along the Watling, he me't the legions
hurrying to his support. Thus strengthened, and searing a sailure os
supplies,⁸ he halted in his retreat and turned upon his pursuers‚ resolved
to stake the whole issue on a battle against overwhelming numbers,
flushed with previous victory and animated to a crowning effort. It was
perhaps never known in Rome how near the tragedy of the Teuto-
burgiensis Saltus had been to repeating itself. But Paulinus, whatever
his errors, was no Quintilius VaruS, nor were the British ranks com-
manded by an Arminius. He was allowed by some strange error of his
enemies to choose his own battleground‚ and chose one where he could
neither be surrounded in the rear nor outflanked.⁴ With this advantage,
the steady valour os the legionaries enabled them to await the decisive
moment when the Britons began to waver under the storm of ‘ pila'‚ and
to break their centre in a wedge-like column.¹⁵ The unwieldy mass
became its own worst enemy ;'the wagons in which their wives had been
brought to see their victory enclosed the rear; the constantly increasing
heaps os slain still further blocked escape; and the carnage was com-

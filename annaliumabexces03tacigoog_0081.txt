[68] INTRODUCTION [anP. 111

to the voice 'of the people, oome forward with a show of reluctance, harp
in hand, scrupulously observing the minutest rules of professional
etiquette, making his obeisance to the demoralized assemblage, and
trembling, or affecting to tremble, before his judges.¹ We are shown
the contrast of the drilled and disciplined applause, and well-assumed,
if not genuine enthusiasrn of his great clientele, the Roman rabble,'
with the ill-concealed contempt of the municipal, provincial, and other
respectable ·sections of the audience, who had to bear the blows of the
soldiers at one moment for slackness„ at another for ill-timed clapping.
We have the higher classeS, not daring to be absent, some crushed
to death in the press, some struck down in their scats by diseases
arising from exhaustion, with every look of wear-iness and disgust noted
down by spies and sure to be sooner or later resented, and Vespasian
scolded by a freedman for nodding in slumber, and brought into such
peril as well-nigh to baulk his destiny.

It must be borne in mind that, side by side with the genuine and
righteous feeling of disgust at this degradation of imperial majesty,
repeating on a greater scale and in more manifold forms the extrava-
gances of Gaius,³ was a less creditable current of old Roman prejudice
against Greek amusements.⁴ This is seen in full strength in the
murmurs at the institution of the ‘ Neronia ’,‘ where Tacitus freely
admits that the force of argument was not wholly on one side‚‘ and
that the gloomy anticipations were not justified by the result! At a
time when the old national military exercises, invidiously contrasted
with the palaestra,⁸ must have been growing more and more obsolete,
we can see that the best minds should have welcomed, on the score
of humanity and refinement‚ any counter-attraction to that of the amphi—
theatre 3 but the feeling above noted is certainly a force to be estimated,
as also the dismay felt at the rush of the Roman nobility to hire them·
selves out for the stage, the circus„ or the arena. Such precedents as
had already existed⁹ must have served only to set off a contrast in

Our history of this prince in Tacitus is on the whole as complete
as that of Tiberius: in both some notice is given of the previous
life, and a full history is preserved of the greater part of the rule ; in
both an important portion is lost to us which is ill made up by what
can be gleaned from other sources. In the 'oese of Nero, the fact that
the lost portion includes the end involves also the loss of any general
judgement which the historiari may have thought fit to give by way
os summary.

We have the notice of his mother’s marriage to Gnaeus Domitius, who
united a descent on his mother’s side from Octavia to the high lineage
of his paternal family‚¹ and who afterwards narrowly escaped peril of his
life by the opportune death of Tiberius.¹¹ His son, originally named
Lucius Domitius, was born at Antium on Dec. 15, 790, ΑΛ). 3¹7,⁸ and
he himself died of a dropsy at Pyrgi about two years later.⁴ His death
was almost immediately followed, or perhaps preceded, by the exile of
Agrippina ⁸ 3 and the child, thus lest practically an orphan, fell under
the charge of his aunt Domitia Lepida, but returned aster little more
than a year to that of his mother on her restoration by Claudius.⁸ It
is idle to speculate on the supposed effects of his aunt's neglect or
indulgence at this early age ’ς but his subsequent intimacy with her, kept
up till she fell a victim to the jealousy of Agrippina thirteen years later‚‘³
may not have been without a share in determining his propensitieS.
Besides receiving back from Claudius his paternal inheritance‚ which
Gaius had seized,· the boy was further enriched by that of his step-

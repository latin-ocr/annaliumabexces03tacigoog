the census then about to be taken (Staatsr.

(49. 43, 6) must be in error in stating that
a previous addition to the patriciate was
made in 721, 1³. e. 33.

Beyond the desire to pay a compliment
to the n thus ennobled, the only

the few offices, such as those os the

3. reeens repertam. In 725, mc. 29,
Augustus had indueed fifty senators to
resign their rank voluntat-ily, and had put
pressure on one hundred and sorty others
to make them follow that example (Dio,
52. 42, 2; cp. Suet. Aug. 35). For other
instanooe of the exercise os this power
see 2. 48, 3: 1 2. 52,4, and notes. Claudius
no doubt enrolled other senators in their
places, among whom were M. Calvius
Priscus and M. Salonius (C. 1. 1.. 10.

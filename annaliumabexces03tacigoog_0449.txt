‘referre' in this sense neema un
dented. The recurrence of ‘ipsius ' again
after ‘fortunam ’ in Med. ia perhaps best
treated by Halm, Nipp., and Dr„ aster
Ern„ aa an error os repetition. Others,
thinking some word needed to balance
the previous ‘ ipsius ⁹, treat it as a corrup·
tion of ⁶ reipublicae ' (after Patent), ⁸ im·
perii’ (aster Jac. Gron.)‚ or ‘ imperatoria’
(aster Sirker). The whole sentence seems
a reminiscence of Sall. Fr. H. ο. 3ο D,
36 Κ, 66 G (‘ adversa in pravitatem,
secunda in casum, fortunam in temeritatem
declinando ’).

parallel passage, ‘ antequam Caesarem

the glory of victory may be considered to
rest mainly on the army, and the general

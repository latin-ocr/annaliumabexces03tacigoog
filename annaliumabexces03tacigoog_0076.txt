The facts of the story, with the exception of some detaiIS,¹⁰ are not

that the keys of a revolution lay within her grasp. On the other hand,
she knew that by success she would only enter on a new phase of

indictment laid before the senate,¹⁸ in which we may be sure that the
ingenuity of Seneca had raked together all that tested on a tittle of fact
or could anyhow be made to seem credible. We are referred back to
her attempts to assume a regency, to her vindictive endeavours to retaliate
on the nobles, soldiers, and people who had refused to swear allegiance

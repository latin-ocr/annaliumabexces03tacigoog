persona} vanity‚ and the desire to outdo his predecessors, must count
sor something. Suetonius, as might be expected, thinks his desire to win
the full honours of a triumph a sufficient explanation of the whole under-
taking ¹; and the monotony with which the rhetorical boast, that he had
been first to extend the empire beyond the Ocean, is paraded in his own
speech‚² in the triumphal inscription,⁸ and in contemporary epigrams,⁴
shows the light in which he wished the achievement to be regarded. The
prominence of'Narcissus in the narrative of the dispatch of the expedition ⁸
suggests the cupidity of freedmen and other courtiers as another great
prompting motive,⁸ and that the increased trade may have led the Romans
to exaggerate the mineral and other wealth of Britain no less than they
had before depreciated it! It must be remembered, however, that the
situation created by Cunobeline's death was such as would naturally call
sor Roman intervention in South Britain. Cunobeline had clearly been
the ⁴ ally and friend of Rome ', and recognized by Rome as king. On his
death, it was for Rome either to recognize his heir as king, or substitute
another successor, or finally to annex the kingdom. The ability and anti.-
Roman sentimenta of Caratacus appeared to the imperial government to

make annexation necessary.
The circumstances of the time were favourable to a new extension of

the empire, in so far as the general tranquillity on the northern and
north-eastern frontier allowed the garrisons there stationed to be re·
duced below the strength which Augustus (in his later years) and
Tiberius had· considered necessary.⁸ It is, however, to the credit of
those who organized this expedition, that they foresaw that it could not
be undertaken without some augmentation of the standing army? and

his contempt of the ‘ acta principum ’, and
his absence from the senate generally, is
as a virtual ‘ abrogatio legum ’.
Tiberius is mentioned (4. 42, 3) as strik-
ing a senator off the roll for not swearing
to the ‘acta Augusti ’.

1. diurna populi Romani z on these
public journals see Introd. i. iii. p. 15.

2. curatius, ⁴ more earefully ἐ cp. 14.

note.

quid 'I'hrasea non feeerit. His
abstentions show the disafl'ected how far
they may go.

3. ma instituta, the republicanism of
Thrasea, explained by ‘ nova cupien-

ubero, a nephew of the ounger Afri·
canus and an opponent of e Gracchi, is
taken as one of the persons of the dia·
logne ‘de Republica’ by Cic„ who else·
where speaks of him as a Stoic of high
character, but of austerity amounting to
rudeness, and as dissslaying ut times a
⁶ perversa sa ientia’( rut. 31, 1173 pro
Mur. 36, 75 ; also as a learned jurist
(Cic. ap. Gell. 1. 22, 7). Seneca praises
his asceticism (Ep. 95, 72, δια). M. Fa·
vonius, who is often mentioned in the
letters of Cicero, was prominent among

the optimates, though personally at eu·

no missive, such as was often sent (see 5.
3, 2 ; 6. 9, 2, &c.), and which would leave
the senate no choiee3 he might sasely
leave it to be ‘ disceptator ⁰, to decide
between accuser and accused on its own
discretion. Nero so far followed this
hint as to write without mentioning
names (c. 27, 2).

10. extollit-‘incendit'. Nero excites
still further the spirit os Cossutianus,
already , from personal animosity
(‘ira’) towards Thrasea (see c. 21, 3).
Tacitus has elsewhere ‘extollere animos
ad superbiam’ (4. 17, 3>= cp. ‘ira.. .

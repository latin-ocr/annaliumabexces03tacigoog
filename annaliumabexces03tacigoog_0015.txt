[2] INTRODUCTION [cHAP. 1

N icoli of Florence, one of the agents employed by him for collecting
manuscripts. In acknowledging its receipt, Bracciolini writes as follows
(Oct. 21), ‘ Misisti mihi librum Senecae, et Cornelium Tacitum, quod est
mihi gratum: at is est litteris longobardis et maiori ex parte caduciS, quod
si scissem, liberassem te eo labore. Legi olim quemdam apud uos
manens litteris antiquis; nescio Coluciine esset an alterius. Illum cupio
habere uel alium qui legi possit: nam difficile erit reperire scriptorem,
qui hunc codicem recte legat; ideo cura ut alium habeam, si fieri potest!
On further examination, he appears to have determined not to keep it,
and writes again to Nicoli (June 5, 1428)² ‘Dedi Bartholomaeo de
Bardis decadem Livii et Cornelium Tacitum, ut illos ad te mittat: in tuo
Cornelio deficiunt plures chartae uariis in locis! The manuscript thus
'returned to Nicoli was bequeathed by him to the Convent of St. Mark;
as appears by an inscription upon it, ‘ Conventus S. Marci de Florentia
Ordinis Praedicatorum de hereditate N icolai N icoli Florentini viri
doctissimi! From thence it was transferred to the Laurentian Library,
where it is at present preserved. The manuscript is written on parch-
ment, and the portion containing Tacitus must have consisted when
complete of 105 leaves (now reduced to 103 by the loss of two leaves
containing respectively Hist. 1. 69-75, and H. 1. 86-2. 2), and contains
all that we have of these later Books of the Annals and the whole extant
part of the Histories‚ all numbered consecutively as Books XVI-XXI.
At the end of the several Books is a subscription, ‘ Cornelii Taciti Liber
. . . explicit, incipit . . .’ The abrupt conclusion of the 16th Book of the
Annals has however no such subscription, and the first sentence of the
Histories is written in red letters of larger size, so as in some sort to
mark a new commencement. Also there is no subscription at the end of
Book XXI (Hist. 5), which leaves off in the middle of a column, so as to
show that there was no more in the exemplar.

It will be seen above, that, even in the time of Bracciolini, the hand-
writing‚ besides being in the difficult Lombard character, had in many
places become faded and indistinct by time.² Since that date, a later
hand has endeavoured to reproduce the text of these passages in the
interlinear spaoes3 and, through errors committed in this attempt, many
false readings have subsequently pa'ssed current as the true Medicean
text.

Many other manuscripts ⁸ of this portion of the works of Tacitus exist,

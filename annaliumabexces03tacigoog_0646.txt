flying columns under his lieutenants Placidus and Traianus against the
scattered ZealotS.¹ He himself had constructed a fortified camp at
Emmaus in Judaea,² from whence, in one short expedition, he reduced
Idumaea, and in another, Samaria3⁸ subsequently to which another
strong position was taken up at Jerich0.⁴ After these successes the
reduction of Jerusalem alone remained : and vigorous preparations were
being made for its siege when the news of the death of Nero obliged him
to await further instructions ; ⁵ and subsequent events prevented any
active resumption of the war till a year and a half afterwards.

Helius, who had frequently pressed Nero to return, went in person to
tell him that a great conspiracy was on foot in Rome, and that his
presence was urgently needed. Nero immediately set sail‚ and narrowly
escaped shipwreck from a storm. Several persons who had counted on
his destruction and rej0iced at it were put to> death.⁸ His return was
marked by extravagances surpassing all before. He entered Rome
through a breach in the walls, after the tradition of victorious Greek
athleteS, in a triumphal chariot‚ bearing the Olympian crown, and holding
in his hand the Pythian, amid the acclamations of the populace,⁷ and dis-
played all his crowns, in number 1808, on the obelisk in the circus, and
again exhibited himself as a charioteer and musician.⁸

Soon afterwards he left Rome for Naples, where, on the anniversary of
the murder of his mother,⁹ the first news was brought to him that
C. Julius Vindex, the legatus of Gallia LugdunensiS,¹⁰ had raised a great
insurrection in his own and in the adjoining Gallie provinces The
account of the nature and purpose of this rising, in the abridgement of Dio
by Xiphilinus, which has been most generally followed,¹¹ represents him as

In the following year he was preparing

¹⁰ Vindex is stated by Dio (63. aa, 1)
to have been an Aquitanian of royal
descent, whose father had become a

²¹ Resides that here 'ven, two other
views have been pnt fort ς the first being
that of Mommsen (Hermes, xiii. 1878,
pp. 90-105)‚ who regards this rising
as a genuine effort to restore the Roman
Republic. This is supported by words of
Zonaras (11. 15), possibly from some
statement of Dio omitted b Xiphilinus,
that Vindex made his fol owers swear

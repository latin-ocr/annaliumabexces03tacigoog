CONQUEST OF BRITAIN

[13⁵]

with Mommsen ¹ and others, that the word read Βοδοῦνοι represents the
name of some tribe which we are unable to identify ¹3 or that, if they are
identical with the Dobuni‚ their submission has been misplaced in order
of time ³ ; the whole narrative can be explained in a far more probable
manner. The three landing points can be placed on the south-eastern
coast ⁸ ; the first point of concentration may have been at or near them;
the resistance will have been encountered still within Kent3 and the un-
named river at which the chief struggle took place could be the Medway.⁸

The time occupied before sending for Claudius, or between that and
his arrival, can only be estimated in the light of the statement that he'
was altogether six months absent from Rome, and returned to it in the
beginning of the following year; which would show him to have left it
about July.⁸ We may suppose Plautius to bave spent the interval in

those ' before him would already
have drained of supplies. Awidely different
view, taken by Profoesor G. B. Airy, ori-
· ally published in the Athenaeum of
ffie 28. 186o,and subsequently (with some
additions) reprinted with other papers
(landon, 1865). holds that the westerly
course mentioned by Dio was really that
from the North Foreland to the coast of
Esses, where the landin took place (prob-
ably at or near Southentffk that the Britons
retreated south-west: that the unnamed
river, the scene of the chief conflict, was
the tidal portion of the Lea3 that the
Britons, retreating thence, crossed to the
south of the Tharnes, followed by the
Romans, who took up a position (prob-
ably at Keston), whence they recrossed
the Thames with Claudius, and struck at
Camulodunum. This view appears to in-
volve the hardly possible supposition, that
the Erimus, instead of fallin back u n
their stronghold at Camul unum, eli·
berately marehed away from it and left it
open to attack, and that the Romans, in-
stead of availing themselves os that op-
fflfftffffissf‘ssoffi’ 3²23 2²33
would have to recross it sor the main ob-
ject os the campaign. Mr. lf'. C. J. Spur-
rell, in a paper read at a meeting of the
Archaeological Institute, November 1888,
takes a view partly in accordance with
each os the above writers, partly distinct
fi'om both. He places the landin on the
Hampshire coast, and makes the omaus
march to Gloucestershire and thence east-
ward till they resch the Lea (the unnamed
riverof Dio) ς whence he also makes them
follow the Brltons southward across the
‘Tharnen (probably near Tilbury‚sup
to he then above thetidal limit),an wait

there for Claudius. The objections to this
view will be gathered from those already
stated. We seem thus to see that no view
is open to sewer objections, or more on the
whole in accordance with the narrative of
Dio, than some such as that here adopted,
making Plautius land at some near points,
and not extend his operations beyond parts
osKent, Sussex, and surrey, till the arrival
of forces under Claudius emboldened him
to cross the Thames once sor all, and

² It {vovultll nc(>t be‘ ar: ⁷{h'rgfgghable
supposition to consider· that the people
{23:335521132‘35533‘ &333¹ss ἓξὲξ
have here taken the place os it) were the
Sussex tribe known to us by what is per-
ha a subsequent Roman designation (see
be ow, p. [136]) as ‘ Regni’.

¹ Some at least of the people inhabit-
ing the district assigned to the Dobuui
would seem to have been still independent
under Andedrigus, at a date subsequent to
that of the first invasion (see below, μβ 38] ‚
n. 3), and to have been associated with the
Iceni rather than the Catuvellauni.

⁴ There is much improbability iu sup·

before landing. The westward course
which Dio (c. 19, 4) describes them as
taking might loosely mean what is strictly
a north-westerly direction to such a point
as Lyrnne. The terrors of the ocean would
lead them to make as short-a passage as
wind and tide permitted.

general and standing grounds of military discontent as were shown in
the mutiny of so many legions at the death of Augustus against an
emperor of known vigour and capacity, who had even been their own
victorious general,¹ would have been aggravated at this time by the
news of the conduct of their imperator in Greece and elsewhere, and
by jealousy at the donatives and other gifts lavished on the praetorianS.⁸
It is again evident that the fate of Corbulo and the Scribonii must have
taught all provincial commandere what they had to expect, and warned
them that it was safer to take advantage of the discontent of the troops
than to repress it ε. and that a state of things would thus come to exist
which a single spark might set in a blaze. For the further progress
of the revolt, the weakness‚ passing at a step from contemptuous indis·-
ference to abject panio, with which Nero attempted to face the situation,
would seem sufficiently to account.

As regards the last crisis, that of the defection of the praetorianS, a
few words of Tacitus come in to confirm the general account. To this
body their long-standing allegiance to the Caesars ⁸ had not only the
force of habit, but was also a necessity os their existence: the proclama·
tion of a Republic would have been their sentence of disbandment 3 nor
had they any desire of their own for even a change of ruler. F ourteen
years of laxity and indulgence had taught them to love a vicious prince
as deeply as their predecessors had ever respected a strict one3 ⁴ and
the contrast of Galba could hardly have been more atu-active in anticipa-
tion than it proved to be in reality.⁸ But the intrigues of Nymphidius⁸
found their all-powerful support in Nero’s own cowardice; and a false
report that the flight which he was known to be contemplating had
already taken place left them no resource but to make the best of the
only rival then before them? however visionary might be their hope
of the enormous donative offered in his name.⁸

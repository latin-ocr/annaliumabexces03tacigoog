G. 34, s), and the ⁴ i ’form of such genl-
tives had so dropped out of use (cp.
Quint. 1. 5, 63) that Pliny (ap. Charis.
107. P.) calls it altogether obsolete. . The
occurrence of the Greek name Heraclesin
those regions hasbeennoticed above; but
the worship was no doubt ounded on that
of some ancient Eastern city. The most
probable identification seems to be that
withthe Assyrian godNin or Ninip,a
deity whose association with Heraclea
seems vaguely indicated by the mythical
pedigreein Hdt. 1. 7, 3, and who cer-
tainly resembled him in attributes, and
vas worshipped as giving the king suc·
cess both in war and hunting'( Rawlinson,
⁴ Five Great Monarchies’, i. p. 159-61).
The identificatious with the Assyrian sun-

San or Sensi, and with the Vere·
t ragna worshipped by the Arians of
Iran and closely associated with Mithras
(see Dnncker‚ Hist. Ant. v. 115, soll.),
seem to be ded on a less close
resemblance.

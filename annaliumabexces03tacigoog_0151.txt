frontier ¹ of the province may have been represented by a line drawn some-
what north of the Thame8‚ and perhaps westward near the MendipS, testing
on Camulodunum (Colchester)‚ and Glevum (Gloucester).¹ Verulamium
would form an intermediate point, and Londinium, with perhaps other

positione, would be places of support in the rear. North of Essex
and Hertfordshire the powerful clan of the Iceni were, as has been said,

the friends and allies of Rome.⁸

‘ Britannic[i] Aug. fi.’, and (on the side)
‘V. et P. §taken to mean ‘Veranio et
Pompeio cos. ). That the Romans pushed
their mining enterprise stin further west,
is in itself probable, but unsupported3 aa
Mr. Haverfield notes that hardly any traces
of Roman mining or occu ation in Corn-
wallare found till a much ater date. We
should therefore suppose that the Dam-
nonii west of the Mendips were not strictly
part of the early province, but ignored, as
not actively hostile.

² In speaking of this or any other line
as a ‘frontier , the term can be only
loosely used.. Mete invasion may have

shown by the disafl'ection with which
Ostorius had to deal (12. 31, 2), and by
the great rising later of even those who
seemed to have been most completely
subjected (¹4· 31-39). lt may however
be taken to be meant that the chief posi·
tions on such a line as is indicated were

rmanently occupied, and were more or
ess supported by communications in their
rear, and that within this limit, conscrip-
tion, tribute. and other incidents of Roman
government were gradually and systema-
tically established.

² Without accepting the view which
makes Glevum to have been held from
the very first campaign (see above, p. [ 1 34],
n. 4), weight must be attached to the evi·
dence given <see M r. J. Bellows, in Trans-
actions of Brtstol and Gloucester Archaeo-
logical Society. vol. i. 1876, pp. 153-166)

at a very early date, probably as soon as it
became evident that South Wales was the
headquarters of the resistance. If the
sanare form and limited area (45 acres)
o the enclosure are correctly given, they
would show that it was laid out strictly as a

The reward of Plautius for these great

it was pushed on to Caerleon, may on
general grounds be considered sufficiently
probable in itself, altho h it has not yet
been confirmed by the iscovery of in·
scri tions or other unmistakable evidence

the Iceni and some other peoples connects
itself with the fortunes of a prince Ande-
drigus; whose name (or some abbrevia-
tion of it) occurs on numerous coins found
in Norfolk. Suffolk, Cambridgeshire,
N orthamptonshire, Glouoestershire, Ox-
fordshire, also near Bath, and (in con-
siderable numbers) near Frome. In Nor-
folk and in Somerset, Roman coins are
found mingled with them, especially in
the latter lace some of Claudius and
Antonia (t e latter imitated), showing
his rule to have continued there after the
Roman invasion (see Evaus, pp. 143-148,
383-3883 Su pt· 489-493, 583-585)·
Dr. Evans inc ines to think that he was
ruling at the time of the Icenian rising
against Ostorius3 but it seems difficult to
suppose the ‘ longa opulentia' of Pratu-
..everaert sss mamm
(of whom nothing is knovzn beyond {is
coinage) may have been leader of a na·
tional and Prasutagus of a Roman party
at the time of the first invasion; and
when the Iceni, at some date between
Α. D. 43 and 47, voluntarily submitted to
Rome (12. 31, 3), the latter was con-
firmed as king, and the former may have
retired westward, and 'maintained himself
there (like Caratacus) as a national leader
of the Dobuni (see above, p. [134 ) and
others, possibly, as Dr. Evans thiu s, till
about ΑΛ). 55. ΪΠιο view that his So·
merset subjects may have been the lead-
producing people whose name is generally
read as ‘Ceangi' is discussed on 12. 32, 1.
The name of Prasutagus has not been
found on any coins3 nor is there distinct
evidence of any later Icenian coinage of
any sort.

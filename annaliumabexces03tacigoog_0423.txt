1. possessor, in a ition.

a. abiudicatis, ‘ en away by deci-
sion ’ (from the occupants).

5. usurpata, ‘ what they had occupied?
The sense of illegal occupation‚ or, in
our sense, ⁸ usurpation,' though found
occasionally in post-Augustan Latin (see
Nipp.)‚ does not seem to be required in
any instance in Tacitus; and in one place,
where that meaning is clearly intended
(3. 60, 5), ⁸ falso' is added.

6. sogipsit, sc. ⁸ senatui '‚ as in suu in
13. 27, .

7. Sequuntur . . . mortes. The verb
may probably here be used only to con-
nect events in order of narration; the
deaths of eminent persons being osten
thus mentioned at the close of a year
(1· §32 ¹33: ⁷5213⁷62 ¹344& 1,&c.);
but in the similar expressions in ¹5· 38, 1;
60, 3, sequence in time is intended. It
may be noticed that Tacitus gives no sup·
port to the statement of Dio (61. 19, 4),
πολλοὶ ἄνδρες τῶν πρώτων ὲν τῷ ἔτει
τούτῳ ἐτελεύτησαν, ὣν ἐνίους καὶ τῷ nk-
ρωνι ἐπιβουλεύειν αἰτηθέντας 01 στρατιῶται
περιστάντες ἐλιθοβόλησαν.

Domitii And: see 4. 52, 1, and note.

8. K. Servi-lii, sc. ‘ Noniani ’‚ ou whom
see 6. 31, 1 ; Introd. i. iii. p. 12.

ιο. celebris: on this masc. form see
2. 88, 4, and note.

elegantia vitae, ‘ retinement of life’3
so in Nep. Att. 19„ 2. Tacitus else-
where has ‘elegantia morum' (5. 8, 4;
H. 3. 39, 3). The expressions are used
in a good sense, and im ly not only high
rank in the social scale, ut also the culti—
vation of the higher tastes and leasures.

clariorem. The context s ows that
the comparison is with the career os

Domitius, who was an accuser under
giberius, and saved his lise by flattering
aius·

11. incenso . . . morum. The abl. and
geuit. are thus inter-changed in ι 3. 54,
6.6 For the genit. with ‘ diversus’ cp. 13.
2 , 2.

12. Cornelio Cosso, given in the
⁴ Acta Arvalium' (C. 1. L. vi. 1. 204²) as
⁸ Cosso Lentulo, Cossi filio ’. He would
appear to have been son of the one men·
tioned as cos. in 4. 34, 1, and probably
father of the vesta! virgin mentioned in
15. aa, 4.

quinquennale ludicrum. that mlled
the ‘Neronia' (Dio, 61. 21, ι), or by
similar nar'nes (Suet. Ner. 21: vit. 4);
on which see Friedl. ii. 436, soll. Suet.
says (Ner. 12)‘instituit et uinqnennale
certamen primus omnium ornae more

there given of its repetitio would show
that he intended the peri o be that of
a Roman ⁸ lustrum', not that of a Greek
πενταετηρίς (which really recurred every
fourth year). His design would seem to
be to celebrate each ⁸ quinquennium ’ of his
rincipate‚ as his predecessors had cele·

ated their ⁴ decennia imperii' (see Dio,
57. 24, 1, δια). with the additional inno·
ration of adapting the celebration to the
great Greek fbssmfflv and with the inten-

tion that it ould be perpetuated. 1t

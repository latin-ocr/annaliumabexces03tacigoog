disbelief3 and the balance which. Tacitus, bere as elsewhere, believes
himself to hold, is shown chiefly in a few points which he alone treats as
doubtful, :while the authorities whom Suetonius or Dio have followed
had assumed thern as certain, but which, when all needful allowance is
made, go for little towards any general reversa! of judgement ; ¹ as is no
less the case with other details in which the accuracy of Tacitus himself-
seems open to question.² Were he acquitted on every one of these
counts in the indictment, one whose victims included every near relation
that he had in the world, and almost every citizen who had given lustre
to the age, would have but little to gain by the verdict. Such names
as those of Britannicus, Agrippina, octavia,- and Antonia, or such as
Seneca, Lucan, Thrasea, Soranus, Corbulo (not to mention many others),
are assuredly to be weighed, not merely counted3 and such justification
or extenuation as is pleaded in one case or another becomes the harder
to sustain when all are viewed together.

In accepting the substantial truth of the record before us, it is but just
to take account of the circumstances and surroundings which helped
to form this prince's character. Besides the vicious domestic influences
with which the training of most young nobles had to struggle,⁸ his life
from childhood had been spent in an atmosphere of salsehood, and
among all the machinery of intrigue and crime by which still in mere
boyhood he had risen to power, with even less experience of life than the
worst of his predecessors; bending his earliest energies to escape by
sair means or foul from his mother’s leading-strings, with the aid of a
brilliant teacher, pliant as a reed, and anxious, with <it may well be) good
ulterior aims, to sustain his own influence over him at whatever moral
eost. His earliest crimes revealed to him the utter degradation of the
senate and people, who received his most flimsy justifications with
effusive servility,⁴ and welcomed the matricide’s return to Rome with
all the honours of a triumph ; ⁵ the former body proceeding, as time

we find an absence of all strategical details, and rarely get even clear
indications of time or place.¹ In the practice of grouping the events
os two or more years together, so much is sacrificed to literary effect
as to leave the time of the year, and even the year itself, and the
distinction of one campaign from another, to be made out from some
incidental allusion to season or climate; and again, the general features
of the physical geography of the country are wholly ignored; the situation
of important places is assumed as known or left altogether vague; and
it is only here and there that the mention of some definite locality gives
any indication of the routes taken or positions occupied. Nor are the
defects less serious in the political history. The policy and instructions
of the Roman government, the nature of the negotiations between the
contending parties, and the terms proposed or rejected on either side,
are oftener left to be gathered than expressly stated.

For most of these defects, Tacitus must himself be held responsible.
We can hardly suppose that the chronology of the oempaigns was thus
confused in the original account; and the knowledge of the geography
of Armenia which had grown up in Greece from the time of the Ten
Thousand, and in Rome from that of the Mithridatic wars, is stated by
Pliny to have entered upon a new era in his time through the additions
made to it by Corbulo and from other contemporary sources.² It is
likely enough, however, that the tendency to grandiloquence noticed by
Tacitus himself in Corbulo,8 had left its traces on his work in some
general exaltation of his own personality, which has been exaggerated
to us rather than reduced, through the desire of the historian to throw ς
a strong light upon what he conceived to be a portrait of true Roman
heroism, in contrast to the degradation and effeminacy of Nero.⁸
Though evidently not altogether blind to -the existence of defects in his
hero,⁸ he has not allowed them to intersere with his idealization3 and

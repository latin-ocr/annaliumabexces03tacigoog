(A c. 16), leaving the legions to follow.
He reached London, only to find that he
could not hold it, and was com lled to
fall back along the road by whic he had
come, abandoning in turn London and
Verulam. At some int beyond Vem-
lam he met the egious who were
hastening to join him, and thus re-
inforeed, he decided to retreat no further
but to give battle. The site of the battle
was probably on the line os the Watiing
St. between Veruiam and Wroxeter‚
certainly not between London and Col·

gested‚ near Chester.—P.]

Londinium. No earlier mention
of London exists. Ptolemy (2. 3, 27)
mentions it as one os the towns of the
Kantii· (see Introd. p. 148, 3); it is the
321⁸* immam :2¹² 3333:

menius (c. 17), and by Ammianus (27, 8).
The words os the latter, ‘Lundinium
(or ¹ Lundinum') vetus oppidum, quod
Augustam posteritas appellavit’ might be
taken (though not necessarily) to imply
that it had become by that time a colony.

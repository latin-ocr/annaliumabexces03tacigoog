CHAP. v] CONQUEST oF BRITAIN [137]

The record of the movements of Claudius, which may probably have
been taken from the ‘ acta publica ⁹, represents him as having been only
sixteen days in Britain‚¹ a space barely sufficient for what Dio tells us of his
doings: that he found the army on the Thames, immediately crossed with it,
fought and won another battle, pushed on to and occupied Camulodunum,
and received the submission os those princes who surrendered on the spot,
and, aster repeatedly accepting the title of ⁸ imperator ’,2 set out for Rome,
sending on Pompeius and Silanus, his sons-in-law‚ to announce his victory.
On his arrival he celebrated a magnificent triumph, followed by games and
other spectacles on a grand scale, and distributed with a lavish hand distinc-
tions and decorations among his followers.⁸ [An important point in
Claudius' arrangements must have been the treaty with Prasutagus, King oi
the Iceni, which secured the sasety of the new province against attacks
from the north. The Iceni are described (Anu. 1 a. 3 ι) as having voluntarily
made alliance with Rome. In the south-east, several tribes formerly subject
to Cunobeline were placed under the mle os the native chief Cogidubnus.]

It is os more importance to endeavour to trace the progress of con-
quest during the three remaining years of the command of Plautius ς
but of these no further record is lest to us than a short summary of the
achievements of Vespasian: that he ⁸ fought thirty battleS, subdued two
powersul natione, took more than twenty towns, and reduced the island
of Vectis (wight)'.⁴ We may however sasely conclude that Plautius'
task was the subjugation and pacification of Cunobeline's extensive king-
dom, and that the pacification οἱ the western portion (Hampshire) in
particular was entrusted to Vespasian and the second Augustan legion.
How sar Vespasian penetrated westward is uncertain, but that he
reached the Mendip hilis is suggested by the pigs of lead from that
district belonging to the year 49 ,ια’ Itis suggested that a very early

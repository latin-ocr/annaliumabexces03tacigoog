to be borne in mind that the interest of posterity gathered chiefly round
eminent individual martyrs; whence the conception os Nero as a per·
secutor would naturally be rather associated with the deaths of the great
Apostles St. Peter and St. Paul than with those os obscure, though even
numerous victimS, who lest no name and appear in no martyrology.²

It will be seen that we do not find evidence in classical or Christian

either have been ignorant of any such terrible sufferings undergone by
his co-religionists, or have sailed to record them if known to him, must
have considerable weight in such a case.⁴

On the other hand, the theory that the Jews may have considered
themselves in danger, and may have been enabled to secure their own
safety, and to shift the suspicion to the Christiana by means of their
influence at court, though equally unattested, is certainly so sar a ‘ vera

the Christians, and previous attempts to arraign St. Paul and others
before provincial tribunals. We appear thus to see that they had
opportunity, and that probably they alone had motives, for endeavouring
to fasten upon the Christians a charge likely in such a state of excite-

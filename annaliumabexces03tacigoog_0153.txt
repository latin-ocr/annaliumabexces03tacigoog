fought under his command.¹ A single sentence, describing the diversion
of the first attack on the Silures by a skilful lateral movement along the
valleys, making North Wales and the adjacent enunties the immediate
seat of war,⁸ seems to be all our record of some three years of conflict,
traces of which may probably be found in the British entrenchments on
the Wrekin and on several other hilis, in some of whose names that of
the chieftain seems to be preserved, in Shropshire and Herefordshire ’ς
one of which (Car-Caradoc, near Church Stretton) confronted at a
distance of some ten miles the Roman position of Viroconium ⁴
(Wroxeter) ς which we may suppose to have become at this time the
headquarters of the attacking force, and probably the station of the
Fourteenth legion.⁸ Nor is anything told us of the circumstances which
led or forced Caratacus, probably in the course of 804, Α.ιι. 51, to stake
his fortunes on a pitched battle, the description of which ‘ resembles that
of many another conflict with Germans or other enemies of similar
quality. The enemy, wrought up to the highest pitch of courage by the
leader’s example and exhortation‚ occupies a carefully chosen position,
strong by nature, and additionally strengthened by stone walls, which are
carried by the Roman ‘ testudo ’ ; a second position further up the
heights is stormed with equal success3 the close attack of the legions,
added to the storm of missiles hurled by the light troops on the bare
heads and unprotected bodies of their adversaries, completing the victory
and carnage. The immediate capture of the wife and daughter, and
surrender of the brothers of Caratacus,⁷ is followed soon by his own
deliverance into captivity‚ and from the time of the transportation of these
illustrious prisoners to Rome ⁸ the great house of Cunobelinus is lost sight
of in British history!

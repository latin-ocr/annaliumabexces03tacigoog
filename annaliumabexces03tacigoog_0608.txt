1. nepotibus. The children of Ru·
henim Plautus are mentioned in 14. 5 ‚ 1.
One of them would be the Rube lius
Blandus addressed in Jnv. 8, 39.

a. proxime ubertatem, ⁸ in a way as

with ⁸ proxime ⁹ cp: note on 15. 15, 6. ⁸

novi-simo servitio, ‘servility at the
last moment ’z cp. 11. 3, 3, and note.

3. in servos, ‘among his slaves’: on
this sense of ⁸ in ⁹
and notes.

4. deducere, ap tly here alone
need, inthe sense o ‘auterre', of inani·
mate goods and chattels.

ad suprema, ⁸for the last act’: cp.
⁸ ad improvisa ’ (H. 5. 16, 1), διο.

ἓ. abscindunt: cp. ¹5· 69, 3, and note.

. properi, adverbial z cp. 6. 44, 1 ; and
other suchnsesnoted in Introd- i. v. ς 6;
Dr. Synt. und Stil, 5 8.

8. relinquerent . . . morituros. Each
prayed that he (or she) might die first
(be spared the pain of seeing the others
die), and yet with the certainty that the
others would die a few momente later,
and not be :pared sor a worse fate. Most
edd. read ⁸ relinquerent ², with inferior
MSS. The Med. ‘relinqueret' can how·
ever possibly be explained by supplying
(with F rost and Pfitzn.) a singular subject
from ‘certatim ’, as it is plain that their
several prayers, not a combined pre-
cation, are spoken os. Walther (who is
followed by Orelli) also retains Med„
bnt less well makes ⁸ anima ' the subject.
‘Et' has here the force os ‘et tamen ’, as
in 1. 13, 2 (where see note), etc.

cp. 1. 55, ος a. 8, 1,

9. ordinem, ec. ‘naturae ’.

10. seniore· : eo generally read by edd.
aster Oberl. on the suggestion of Acid.
Med. has ⁸ seniore ⁹, the old edd. ⁸ senior ’.
The text, as here given, may be one in
which conciseness has been studied at the
expense of accurate expression 3 and ⁸ sen-
iores prius ’, in the light of the preceding
sentence, may be understood to mean not
only that Sextia and Vetus died before
Pollitta, but also that the former died
first of all. Stin, a more exact expres-
sion would be expected3 also the words
‘cui prima aetas would more naturally
designate a child than one old enough to
have been some years previously a wife
and a mother. These consideratione give
much force to the alternative s gestion
of Aeid„ that ‘senior'is the rig t read·
ing, and that ⁰ prima ⁸ is corrupted from
an abbreviation of ⁸ proxima ’. 'l'hat the
youngest died last, would thus be left as
an obvious inference.

11. more maiorum: cp. 2. 32, 5, and
note 3 14. 48, 4.

[et Nero interuenit. There ie no
need sor Hujlm’s silent alteration of ⁸ et'
to ⁸ at ’.—F .

12. interce-sit: cp. 14· 48, 3, διο.

eine arbitro, ⁸ without interserenee ’
(cp. 1. 26, 63 15· 17, 5), Le. without
sending a centurion to execute the sen-
tence or see it executed. ‘Mors sine
arbitro ’ is thus equivalent to ⁸ liberum
morgi-s arbitrinm’ (c. 33, ²3 11. 33, 3,
1 . , 1 .

CHAP. 111] RULE oF CLAUDIUS [23]

unawares in full view of the end for which he 3ηά 1113 adherents may have
been none the less deliberately laying their plans.
⁸ Our most serious loss is that of the record and judgement of Tacitus
respecting the first 3ηά 11331 years of this principate, one which we oeri
the better realize by reflecting how much less we should have known
of the rule of Tiberius, if the first three Books of the Annals had not
come down to us. As regards mere material, it is no doubt true
that our other authorities here do more to fill the gap. JosephuS, by
large portioris of 1113 narrative, and especially by the original texts
of edicts of the emperor and of Petronius, his legatus in Syria,
preserved in it, has given us valuable information 011 many subjecte,
especially on the policy adopted towards the Jewish 1333 ¹: a few facts
of historical interest may 113 found among those noted by the elder
Pliny; to his nephew we owe the touching history of Paetus and Arria¹;
and the reader may derive entertainment‚ if not instruction, from Seneca,
whose disregard, not only sor truth, but even for his own consistency,
allows 113 10 find, in what he says of Claudius, 311 equally extreme
instance of each of the kinds of falsification, in which Tacitus tells us
that the 1113101133 of the whole period covered by his Annals abounded.⁸
In the ‘ Consolatio ' addressed from his place of exile to Polybius,⁴ the
resources of language can hardly find terms for the gentlencss 3ηά
clemency ⁶ of the prince under whom it was the freedman's happy
lot 10 live, 3ηά under whom 31311 exiles rested in peace! Fortune
is prayed to preserve one granted to the relief of a worn-out age, and
herself bidden to learn from him to be mercisuU He is himself
imagined as drawing 011 1113 unrivalled stores of his eloquence 3ηά
learning to address topics of consolation to his minister ⁸ ; whom the
writer bids to seek his own solace in the sunshine of that presence,⁹
of that deity within whose influence no sorrow 3311 133311 111111.ιο Itis
hard indeed to believe that we are reading from the same author whose

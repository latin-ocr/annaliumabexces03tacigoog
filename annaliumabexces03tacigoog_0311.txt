CORNELII TACITI ANNALIUM

[A. D. 53

ritaret3 Britannico successore nullum principi metum: at
novercae insidiis domum omnem convelli, maiore flagitio quam
si impudicitiam prioris coniugis reticuisset. quamquam ne 4
impudicitiam quidem nunc abesse Pallante adultere, ne quis
5 ambigat decus pudorem corpus, cuncta regno viliora habere.
haec atque talia dictitans amplecti Britannicum, robur aetatis 5
quam maturrimum precari, modo ad deoS‚ modo ad ipsum
tendere manus, adolesceret, patris inimicos depelleret, matris

etiam interfectores ulcisceretur.

lina and Silius of a similar desigu. On
the other hand, if they were got rid
of and Britannicus were the reco ized
successor, Claudius (whom it was t e es·
pecial object of Narcissus to save) had
nothing to fear, for the boy's youth made
it his interest and that of his partisans
that Claudius should live as long as pos·
sible; but A ‘ppina was bent on up-
{1335 ifintssifw &33:321333333323·
is the interpretation of ‘ si Nero impe -
taret ³, which in its only natural meaning
(⁸ if Nero were to become emperor ')
spoils the sense (the chief object of an
accusation being to prevent his becoming
so), and which may probably have been
a blundering marginal note interpolated
into the text. Orelli and others have
gone further, and bracketed all the words
‘si Nero . . . successore’ as two glosses
explanatory of ⁸ seu Britannicus rerum
seu Nero poteretur ’, and explained the
sense to be that another such plot as that
of Messalina and Silius was on foot, but
that Claudius had no fears (did not see his
danger). But this view, as well as that
of Freinsh.‚ who brackets all the words
‘si Nero . . . at ', and of Nipp., who
brackets ‘pares . . . esse ' and ‘ Britannico
successore (retaining the Med. ‘ meri-
tum ⁸), appear to overlook the needful·
ness of some mention of Britannicus in
context with ‘ novercae insidiis ’, and also
the stress laid on ‘ principi’; the point
being that Narcissus, though he had
little to hope from either successor, de·
sired to reserve Britannicus instead of
gero, wi a view to the safety of Clau·
us.

abs. (⁸ while the outrage was greater than
it would have been,’ &c.).

of the older edd. follow inferior MSS. in
inserting ‘ Claudius ⁹, which must have
been a‘n erroneous gloss, as the death of
Claudius took place at Rome in the
Palatium. Dio states (60. 34, 4) that
Narcissus suffered from gout, and that
the springs of Sinuessa were a specific
for that complaiut: Pliny (N. H. 31. a,
4, 8) gives them a different virtue (⁸ steri-
litatem seminarum et virorum insaniam

Tacitus so speaks os the ‘ magnum corpus ⁹
of the Semnones (G. 39, 4) and the word
is osten thus used in Livy, e. g. ‘ sui corporis
regem ⁹ (1. ¹⁷2 a). Some indication os the

clause also, and the four urban tri alone
are meant. There is evidence that freed-
men shared in the public corn dole, even
under the Re ublic (see Dio, 39. 24, 1‘;
also Momms. taatsr. iii. 446, ι), and their
enrolment in the tribes was probably for
this purpose (Momms. i. 341, 53 iii. 461) ς
such enrolment being ap arently distinct
from the privilege of ad g the name os
the tribe to their nal ‘ nomina ⁹, and
the right (now obsolete) of voting in tribes
or centuries (Id. iii. 446).

deourias. Those here meant are such
as the ‘ lictores ³, ‘ scribae ⁹, ⁴ praecones ’,
and ‘ viatores ³. They are at least verbally
distinct from ‘collegia’ (Momms. i. 341,
5), aud are associated with ‘tribus'z cp.
‘ veterani decuriae tribus ' (Suet. Aug. 57),
‘ implevimus tribus decurias palatium se·

2. cohortium ΤΙιε ‘vigiles’ (Introd. i.

hortes' were os the same status as the
praetorian (4. 5, 5). For an instance of
the enrolment of freedmen in the legions,
see note on 1. 31, 4.

beenp restenggtsed to ‘ ingenffi ’ os three
generations (ΡΙ. N. H. 33. 2, 8, 32); but
this rule must have always had exceptions
and was now much relaxed. The four
brothers Vitellii, all senators of the highest
rank, were sons of a knight, who (ac-
cording to the most probable account)
was himself son os a freedman (Suet. vit.
2), as was also the knight Vedius Pollio
(see 1. 11, 4); and Pliny mentions (Ep.
212¹? ’Ra‘ ὴὴεζᾱῗὲῗέοῗοῃ Ῡιῖιξῗξοῖηοῖῗὲ

have been thought to indicate such an
origin (see others noted in Merivale c. 68.
p. 605). Freedmen themselves became
senators under Commodus (vit. Comm.

distinction drawn is between ‘iusta ma·
numissio’, whether by ‘ vindicta ', ‘ testa-
mentum’, or ‘ census (enrolment ou the
list of citizens by the censor), and that
of a more private character, whether

Nipp. rightly explains the absence of
mention here os the two latter kinds of
‘iusta manumissio ’ by pointing out that
manumission by census must have become
practically obsolete through the disuse of
the censorshi , and that that by wiu could
only take e ect on the testator’s death,

Med. textz and Walther⁸a interpretation

‘ superest ⁸) is generally received, as mean-

restasour due ⁸ (cp. 1. 35, 3)3 soall recent
edd„ after Halm and Oelschliiger, for
Med. ⁶ quietem respondere⁸, sor which
most of the older edd. had read ⁴ quiete
respondere ⁸, endeavouring to give the
words some such meaning aa ‘ satisfy all
claims on us b testing quiet). Several
other suggesteff readings are given by
Walther and Orelli.

ο. in tuam eloi-iam cedet, ⁴ will go
to swell your same ' (c . 1. 1. 3, and
note). Dr. cites Curt. 3. ‚ 18 (“ temeritas

‘provectos ' 11. 6, 4)3 soused sorvarious
other compounds, as ‘ advehere ⁸ (11. ¹4,

5. occurren, taken hy Nip . as sut„

is used in the sense of ‘respondere' in
Cic. de Fat. 18, 41 (⁴ illi tattoni . . . sic

Suet. Aug. 15 3 Val. ΕΙ. 7, ²23· ‘Statim’
is taken in contrast with ‘ meditatae, for
which cp. 13· 3, 6.

id primum. δια, ‘this is the first gift

expedire, ‘to express.⁸ The use of
this verb in the sense os ‘exponere ⁸ (cp. 4.

The context shows that his age, not their-u,

ouius auotoritas, auc. The sense is
that Augustus did indeed it hia
friends to retire into private ise, but he
had reached an age when he could grant
them this or anything else without sear

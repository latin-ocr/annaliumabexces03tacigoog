Egnoured privately under Trajan; and
their birthdays were kept as festivals,
even at this time. by men of ublican
sentimum, as Thrasea and elvidius
(Juv. 5, 36). 1t is possible that the point
of the charge here lies in the inscription
⁴ duci partium ’ς or that the form of such
goffibimry decrees (see 3. 32, 3) may

ve now extended, as in other cases (see
11. 35, 2), to mere possession3 perhaps

6. Torquatum: see 15. 35, 1, where
the charge of having freedmen with such
titles is mentioned.

7. inania, διο.. referred only to ‘ prae-
ficeret . . . libertos ’. Such an act would
not have been positively illegal, and (in
his csse) the charge was also salse. On
such an accus. in apposition see Introd.

8. intentior metu. The sear uni-
versally revalent had made him all the
more on is guard (cp. 14. 3, 3) in general,
and the fate of his uncle had been a
special warning against that particular
ground of offenoe (Nip .). For the con·
struction ‘exterritus ad” cp. 3. 49, 1, and
note on s. 63, 3.

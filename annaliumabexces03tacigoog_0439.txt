quasi cunctam regionem muneri accepissent, avitis bonis

Andedrigus. See Introd. p. 138, 2.

Recent edd. follow Haase in supposing
Tacitus to have uniformly written it as
⁸ Boudicca'‚ which would appear to be
equivaleut in meaning to such a Latin
name as ‘victorina' (Rhys 278). The
form ‘Boadicea’, which rests on no
authority and eonveys no meaning, has
unfortunately, like the similar error ‘ Car-
actacus ² (see on ιη. 33,1), become popular,

He had no male heir, and his kingdom
would on his death lapse to Rome. In
order to eusure its ceful transferenoe‚
and to secure g treatment for his
family (‘ regnumque et domum ⁷), he left
half his private property to Caesar. But
his hopes were disappointed, for his king·
dom was violently seized as if captured
in war (⁴velut capta '), and his own
pro rty and family treated as the spoils
of e victor.-P.] . .

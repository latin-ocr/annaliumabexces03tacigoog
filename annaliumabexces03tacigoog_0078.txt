enar. 111] RULE OF NERO [65]

The divorce and murder of Octavia have been always looked upon
as beyond the reach of question or palliation3 and such details as are
given by other authors agree in the main with Tacitus,¹ We may note
how the long hesitation of Nero was warranted by the difficulties which
actually took place, by the break down of the first attempt to set up
a charge against her through the unflinching loyalty of most of her
slaves, and by the reception of the first news of her divorce with such
a demonstration of popular feeling as had rarely set itself up against
a Caesar.8 The display of force with which it was met was a sufficient
deterrent to prevent a repetition ’ς Anicetus was only too ready to
crown one infamy by another⁴; and after the mockery of a domestic
trial on the renewed charge of adultery, she was sent to the ill-omened
rock of Pandateria, where the end soon followed.⁸ The tragedy of her
life, more terrible than perhaps any in history or legend, is brought
out by the eloquent description of the historian.⁶ Some nine years ago
she had in mere childhood entered as a bride the house which was
to be a living tomb to her; her father’s had been followed rapidly by
her brother’s murder3 her husband had treated her from the first with
coldness and aversion‚ regarding her very parentage and the popular
sympathy with her as a grievance,⁷ and had given such affection as was
in his nature to give, first to a freedwoman, then to a rival bent on
compassing the wife’s destruction3 even in Agrippina her last protector
of some sort was taken from her; her degradation was embittered by
the foul outrage of the charge preferred against her; her place of exile
called up only the memory of those who before had perished in it ; her
last piteous appeal was addressed to none but the soldiers who had
command to execute her; her liseless head was brought to be her
rival's gazing·stock. When he comes to the decree of thanksgivings
and votive offeringS, Tacitus can only beg the reader to take for granted
what he cannot bring himself to specify.⁸

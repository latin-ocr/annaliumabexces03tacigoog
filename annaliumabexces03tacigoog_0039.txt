[26] INTRODUCTJON' · [cmv. 111

The emperor had also to define the rule to which he had succeeded ; and
in this it is hardly too much to say that the lines of the imperial constitution
had to be retraced. The memory of the late tyranny was effaced, the ex-
travagant titles adopted by Gaius were abolished, his ‘ acta ' rescinded, his
exiles, especially his two sisters Agrippina and Julia, recalled, many os his
extortions and confiscations restored to the sufferers or their heirs, his
statues were silently removed, his debased coinage was called in.¹

In name and form, the Augustan idea of a citizen prince was to be
restored. The most sacred oath of Claudius was ‘ per Augustum ¹ ’ ; and,
to associate himself with a divine ancestry, he procured for his grand-

, mother Livia a tardy deification, with special honours to keep up her

name.⁸ Further respect was shown to the memory of his still popular
brother Germanicus, his father Drusus, his mother Antonia3 and even
her father M. Antonius was honourably mentioned.⁴ By thus promi-
nently bringing into notice his relationships to the previous ruling house,
and by himself assuming the cognomen ‘ Caesar ¹, he would endeavour
to sustain the fiction of a continuity of succession 3 though his name was
still significant of a change3 the house of the Julii Caesares, to which
Augustus and his successors had nominally and by adoption yet belonged,
having been left without any male representative at the death of GaiuS,
while no such family as the ‘ Claudii Caesares ' had ever existed, and the
name would seem to an antiquarian genealogist a strange misnomer.
From this time, therefore, it was distinctly to be understood that fCaesar ’
had passed from a family name to an immrial title.

The Claudian name was sufficiently near to the Julian to prevent
the few remaining great houses from feeling degraded by its exaltation,
and some of the most prominent were conciliated by politic alliances.
The infant Octavia, whose name recalled the sister os Augustus (her
ancestress in a threefold line), was promised in marriage to L. Junius
Silanus, the great-great·grandson of Augustus ⁶, while Antonia, the
emperor’s daughter by Paetina, was betrothed to Cn. Pompeius Magnus ⁸,
a representative not only of that famous name, but also of the Calpurnii
PisoneS‚ the Licinii Crassi, and Scribonia.

Besides thus winning the support of great families, he conciliates the

enar. 111] RULE OF NERO [55]

would undo all that she had done3 Britannicus was fit to enter upon
manhood‚ and was the rightsul heir3 she would stand at his side before
the soldiers and brave the upstarts to do their worst.¹ To this de-
fiance the murder of Britannicus was the answer,¹ and conveyed a
waming that she had to do with a nature as unscrupulous as her
own.⁸ The weak counter-move by which she took the injured wife
Octavia under her patronage, and attempted to form a party within
the state,⁴ was met no less decisively. The guard, with whose officers
she was tampering‚⁶ was withdrawn from her doors ’ς the decaying
nobility, to whom she was paying new court,‘¹ quickly forsook her levees
when she was removed to another house from the palace⁸; and the
position which she had been so laborious in building was shown to be
founded on a saud-heap.’ Her enemies are now emboldened to strike
even at her life, and a charge made up against her by clients of Junia
Silana, and supported by the emperor's aunt Domitia‚¹⁰ is represented
as almost scaring Nero already into matricide.¹¹ But she was still
too formidable to be thus brought to bay: Burrus and her accusers
are overpowered by her passionate reply ς an interview with her son
obtains rewards for her friends and punishment for Silana and her
tools ¹²; her mere words, ‘ the incautious utterances of affectionate
jealousy’,¹’ are not yet to be weighed against all that she has done
and dated for Nero; and with this last successful stroke she is for
three years lost sight of, till a new force arises to compass her
destruction.

It is of more importance to trace the ideal of government conceived
for the young prince by Seneca, and the extent to which it was
realized.

After a few graceful sentences on his own position,¹⁴ the Augustan
programme is once more proclaimed, and the duality of government‚
which had become more and more a fiction, is ostentatiously paraded‚¹⁶
with a popular disclaimer‚ like that of his predecessore,¹⁸ of what had
made the preceding rule most odious, especially of the passion for

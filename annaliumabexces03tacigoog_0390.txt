4. mmm. This province, including
all between the Scine and Rhiue, except
what belonged to the ‘ Germaniae’, was
governed by a legatus of praetorian rank,
who resided at Durocortorum Remorum
(Rheims): see Marquardt, Staatsv. i.
Ρρᾶοιίεῐέιῖτὲἔιέο, &c. The sentences iu-
trodueed by ‘ ne' here express not so
much what he was deterred from doing as
the arguments urged upon him: cp. 15.

Upper Germany would have to enter
Belgica in the construction of these works.

5. studia Galliarum. The Med. ‘in
studia' is taken to be a repetition from
‘inferret ’. On the elementa of rebellion
still supposed to exist in Gaul, cp. 11. 1,

the strip of land on the right bank of
the lower Rhiue, which was closed to

of the frontier garrisons (infra, 55. 3).

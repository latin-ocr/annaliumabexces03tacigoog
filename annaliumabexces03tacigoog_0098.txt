caan. 111] RULE OF NERO [85]

step his secession ¹ stom the state; and it was easy to 'conceive him as
another Tubero or Favonius, as bent on ‘ first destroying the empire sor
liberty, then liberty itself ’ for something yet more visionary.⁸

Is Nero contemplated any general blow at the whole body,⁸ he took, as
was usual with him, but one step at a time, and struck down those only
whose position gave importance to their tenete.. Even as it wasa, to force
the senate to condemn such men was beyond anytbing which he had yet
demanded os it3 a'nd there may have been as much real timidity as
artifice in choosing the moment when public attention was taken off by
the approach of Tiridates: in the rescript pointing to Thrasea without
venturing to name him‚⁶ in raising the cry that the whole constitution was
at stake, in menacing the senate, apparently under pretext of protection‚
with an unpreoedented show os military force!⁸

Of the one long day's sitting ’ we have but the record os the touching
desence of Servilia and Soranus,⁸ of the baseness of one client of the
latter ⁹ and the loyalty of another,¹⁰ of the intimidated senate in the midst
os bristling weapons, yet deeply moved by the memory os the venerable
leader ¹¹ who had not stooped to sace the indignity os trial,¹⁸ and powerless
to aequit even his still more innocent associates.¹’ Beyond this, we have
the base decision, the vote of an enormous reward to the accuserS,
and the hardly complete description of the end of Thrasea,¹¹ reminding
us in many points of that of Seneca. If such death scenes seem to us

to be rather theatrical than genuine, it is well to be reminded that ,

⁸ it is the privilege of patriots in miserable times to be excited‚ strained‚
unnatural3 and hence we can understand how it was that from the
Gitondists of F ranoe the Roman Stoics obtained such sympathy and
admiration ’.¹⁸

After we lose the guidance os Tacitus, but few names, and hardly any-
thing more than the names, of further victims survive to uS. The

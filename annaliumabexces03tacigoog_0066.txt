enas. ιιι] RULE OF NERO [53]

one who had loaded his life with indulgences,¹ brought about the cata·
strophe of Oct. 12, 807, run. 54. The praetorianS, schooled sor more
than three years by their praefect,¹ and already tampered with,⁸ were
not slow to earn their donative ⁴; the legions had been probably
secured by similar means⁸ 3 and before the same day closed, a single
sitting of the senate had confirmed the youth, who still wanted two
months of completing his seventeenth year, in all the imperial powers
and privileges„⁸

In his sketch of the rule of Nero, Tacitus has plainly intended each
Book to constitute a period; and of these, that included in the Thirteenth
Book, comprising the fragment of 807, iun. 54, and the four complete
years following it, has won celebrity as the ‘ quinquennium Neronis ’.7
At its outset, the central figure is that of the cmpress mother, who
had seemed to have gained the aim of all her crimes, and to have
only to step into the position won and take up the teins of power.
With even a small share of the tact and skill with which Livia had
adapted herself ‘to the finesse of her husband aud pretences of her
son ’‚⁸ and had enjoyed a lifetime os no less substantial than informa!
power,’ she might have succeeded in the comparatively easy task of
moulding her young son to her will; and to any less irnperious nature,
the outward show of dignity granted her would have been ample. ‘ The
best of mothers ⁹ ¹⁰ was the first watchword given by Nero to the prae-
torians; the honours awarded to Livia at the death of Augustus were
again repeated,¹¹ and additions made to them. Her image appears on
the coinage of her son,¹¹ as before on that of her husband ¹³ ς the Arval
Brothers are permitted to use words implying her virtual association
in government ¹⁴5 even some exercise of imperial functions which she
chose to usurp were acquiesced in¹⁸ 3 she had secured in the subservience

people, governed as provincial subjecta were still too often governed.
In the Annals¹ the wrongs of at least the Iceni and Trinovantes are ¹
definitely specified; we have the personal outrage inflicted on Boudicca
and her daughters, the extortionate spirit in which the Romans exactcd
the inheritance left to them by the old king Prasutagus, the spoliation ἵ
and even enslavement of the ,Icenian nobles; while the Trinovantes l
bad been goaded to despair by the violence of the veteran colonists ot' l
Camulodunum, by the consecration os their slavery in the erection of a ³
temple there to Claudius, and by the exactions ot' the priests at that alien ³
sanctuary. Dio tells us' that the procurator was treating as revocable,
and actually reclaiming, the former bounty of Claudius to friendly chief-:f '
tain8‚ and adds that at the same time Seneca was rigorously exacting·

from the overburdened people the repayment of a loan of forty
million HS, which he bad induced them against their own will to

contract.

The fatal confidence which had banished all the legions to a distance
and lest the beart of the province unguarded,⁸ was now signally chastised.
The seeble garrison of Camulodunum, with the trifling reinforcement
thrown into it by the procurator, was speedily overpowered‚ its only
stronghold‚ the temple precinct, was stormed, its garrison massacred.
and the obnoxious procurator only saved by ssight to Gaul. A still
graver disaster followed: the Ninth legion, hurrying rapidly to the
rescue, probably from Lindum,⁴ under Petillius Cerialis, was cut to
pieces‚ and only the legatus and the cavalry escaped.⁸

In endeavouring to retrieve the terrible consequences of his own
negligence, Suetonius had probably as arduous a task before him as had
ever fallen to the lot of a Roman general. We may suppose that the
Fourteenth legion had accompanied him to Mona, with perhaps part of
the Twentieth, that the remainder of that legion was at Deva, the Second

1. Arriae matris. Her mother (whose
name she bore) had voluntat-ily shared
the death of her husband Caecina Paetus,
condemned for his share in the conspiracy
of Camillus Scribonianus against Clau-
dius in Α. D. 42 (Dio, 60. 16, 6). Her
heroisin in dying first to inspirit her
husband, end her words, ⁴ Paete, non
dolet,’ have been made famous by Pliny
(Ep. 3. 16, 6) aud Murtial (1. 14). The
old Life οἱ Persius states that he was re·
lated to the younger Arria, and through
her en‘oyed much os the society ofThrnsea.
The atter had married her before the
death of her mother, whom he also en·
deavoured to turn from her p ose
(Plin. 1. l. ιο). This Arria lived to are
the exile os her daughter Fannia (on
whom nee note on c. 28, 2), when the
latter was banisbed sor the third time Pl.

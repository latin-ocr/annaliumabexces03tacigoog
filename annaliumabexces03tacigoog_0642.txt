SUMMARY OF EVENTS TILL NERO'S DEATH 475

surgents under Eleazar and his rival Manahem.¹ After seven days os
comparative inaction, the contest was soon decided. The castle of
Antonia was carried after two days’ assault, and its garrison put to the
sword; the palace of the Upper City, after a more vigorous resistance,
was· evacuated under capitulation by the troops of Agrippa, and the
remaining Romans, who had taken refuge in the three towers os Herod,
were induced to surrender on similar terma, and then slain in defiance of
the agreement.¹

A great massacre of Jews by GreekS, which had taken place at the
same time ⁸ at Caesarea, and had been followed by similar scenes at many
other placeS,⁴ made the struggle more intemecine; and the victorious
party at Jerusalem, encouraged‚ as they believed, by the voice of
prophecy,⁶ took the offensive in the surrounding country.

A greater crisis now ensued on the advance of Cestius GalluS, the
legatus of Syria,⁸ with a large force of legionary and other troops, to
put down the insurrection. After meeting with little resistance and in-
flicting many cruelties elsewhere,⁷ he sustained a severe check near
Beth-horon,²³ but was enabled by the dissensione of his adversaries to ad-
vance to the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, and even into the city; whence,
after seeble attempts to assault the Upper City and the Temple, he set
out on a retreat almost degenerating into a tout, in which nearly 6000 of
his troops were killed? On this success not only Judaea, but also
Galilee, Samaria, Peraea, and Idumaea, burst out into a blaze os open
rebellion.

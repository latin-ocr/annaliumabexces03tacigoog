2. Antio: ep. c. 3, 13 she earne thence
by ship. Dio states (61. 12, 3) that Nero
took her up and brought her with him by
aea, using the ship which had been pre·
pared for the murder, in order to ac-
custom her to it. According to the
account of Suet. (Ner. 34),she had arrived
in a ship of her own, which Nero caused to
be disabled, as if byan accidental collision,
so as to oblige her to use for her return
from Baiae to Bauli the one which he had
prepared for her. · . ι

It had belonged to the orator Hortensius,
and afterwards to Antonia (Plin. N. H. 9.
55, 81, ¹7²), through whom it became
imperial pro rty. The name of the

(Symm. Ep. 1. 1); whence it has the
epithet ‘ herculei’ in Sil. 12, 156. We
are to understand the version here given
to be that Nero conducts her from the
landing·plaee to this villa as her resi-
dence during her stay, and invites her to
dine with him at another villa at Baiae
(see note and reading on ς 6), that the
highly decorated ship was awaitiug her
arrival, and was supposed to be placed at
her disposal during her visit as a mark of
honour, that she went on to Baiae in a
litter, but was afterwards induced to use
the ship for her return. So Suet. (1.1.)
after saying ‘ Baias evocavit ’, makes the
shipwreek happen ‘ repetenti Baulos '-

7. invitata ad epulas. Tacitus knows
nothing of the story (Suet. oth. 3) that
Otho acted as nominal host‚which, if true
at all, may possibly be referred to some
previous attempt on Agrippina's life. See

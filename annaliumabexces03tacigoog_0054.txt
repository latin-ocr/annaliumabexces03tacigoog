the same terms as by others; as 0118 whose unbridled profligacy made
a pastime of the interests of the state,¹ whose influence was used solely
to exalt her favourites or to destroy those who disdained her advances,
or in any way crossed 1181 path. Of the ‘ many murders perpetrated
at her bidding’,¹ we may take as a sample the case with which the
Eleventh Book opens, in which, to appease the mere jealousy of 112111011-
11822 and the further promptings of cupidity‚ four lives at once are
sacrificed.⁸ It is her will to destroy a rival 111 1118 affections of 2
pantomimist, and yet to spare her favourite himself 3 and the coveted
possessions of the senator on whom the charge is shifted make him
all the more a welcome victim. Men of the highest rank are ready
111 2 moment to effect her purpose; a consular accuser takes together
all the antecedente of the accused to secure a conviction, and when even
the intimidation exercised by her own presence⁴ was insufficient to
coerce her husband's judgement‚ when the graver charges are on the
point of ignominiously breaking down, and the defence had even extorted
some touch of womanly feeling from 1181118113Β 1118 111021 influential senator
of the day steps in to gratify her still relentless purpose by ensuring
the sate of the accused through a ready 2112128812,α while she herself,
by mere force of 11118212, terrifies Poppaea into suicide ι ⁷ two eminent
knights are attached by the well-worn artifice of a dream story, and
condemned by a subservient senate to complete her vengeance ; ⁸ and
the dotard, who had even sorgotten that any charge against Poppaea
existed,’ has instilled into him a vindictive hatred of the memory ¹⁰ of
the man whom, if left to himself, he would ‚have acquitted, and is
persuaded to heap rewards on those who had taken even an insignificant
share in the transaction.¹¹

To such a narrative the only fitting climax is supplied by that of
her last catastrophe ς in relating which Tacitus pauses for a moment
to bespeak the readers’ credence by an earnest protestation that he
has added nothing to the record of his authorities.²² The story as it
stands is indeed of so astounding a character that it has been thought

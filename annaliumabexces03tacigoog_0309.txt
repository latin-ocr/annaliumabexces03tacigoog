others, especially ιι comet, which is at·

seems no reason to read‘ fastigium’, with

not ‘insideo ' (see the use of the two verbs
in Tacitus, as shown in Gerber and Greef’s

Lex.) und, though the former verb else·
where (some twenty· -five times) takes an
aecum in Tacitus (except perhapsin 4. 67,
5), the dative ts certainly supported from
Vergil (Aen. 6, 708), und perhaps from
several other passages.

examen apium. The smuning ot
bees in any unusual place was generally
regarded ns a portent by Romans (Cic.
deHar.Resp.12,25; L1v.21.46‚2; 24.

Pliny thinks (N. H. 11. ι7. 18‚55) thet
the haruspices were wrong in always
treating it as a sign of evil, ss it had
sometimes clearly portendedg ood.

with Madvig (Adur. ii. 552), that the m.

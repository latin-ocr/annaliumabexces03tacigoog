emp, 111] LIFE OF CLAUDIUS [19]

Within these narrow limits is confined all the help that we can obtain
from Tacitus towards judging Gaius either in youth or manhood3 nor
have we any reason to suppose that this history, is it had come down
complete to us, would have tended to reverse, however it might in degree
have modified, the judgement which has gibbeted this tyrant among the
monsters of mankind.

Tru remaining fragment of our historian's narrative os the principate
of Claudius, though comprising probably more than one third of the
whole, sails us in the most important part 'of his mle, as well as in the
period immediately preceding it. It is also unfortunate that Tacitus has
not thought fit to give at the close of his life any general summary of his
character, as is done in the Annals for Tiberius,¹ and in the Histories
sor Galba,² and also (more briefly) for Otho ³ and Vitellius.⁴

What is lest to us cannot be justly estimated without reviewing at some
length such account as we have of the fifty-five previous years of his
private and public life.

On his early history Suetonius ⁸ is our sole authority. It is from him
that we get the picture of the boy born barely a year before his father’s
death, harassed in childhood by such a succession of illnesses as perma-
nently to affect mind and body, regarded with contempt by his relations,
with aversion even by his mother, ⁶ kept in retirement while his popular

praebuissetque materiem obtrectatoribus arguendae sententiae.

3. νιιιεαιιιιιιιιιιιιιι, ‘most common·
place’ (i. e. most unimportant): cp. ‘vul a·
ribus patrum consultis‘ (16. 22, 1),‘ ni il
tam vul age’batur (Plin. Pan.
54), whence Ηιιειιοῖξο followed by all recent
edd. except Ritt. t us corrects here the
Med.‘ uulgatissimum', which would mean

‘most generally known'. No comparative
or su rlative οἱ* vu ³ is however
elsew ere found. In Dial. 6, 5, to which
Ῑζὶιέ,ο refers, ‘ vulgaria ’ is now generally
rea

that ιιι Rome there should not be, except
by special decree, more than two public
gladiatoria] shows in the year, and that
the number οἷς ladiators should not exceed
120 (Dio, 5ᾼὲ 2, 4); Tiberius appears to
have made some turther reduction (Suet.
Tib. 34l, but the rule was relaxed by
Gaius (Dio, 59. 14, 3). The number

itted in Italian towns is not known,
ut we find as many as thirty and thirty-
five pairs contending at Pompeii (C. 1. L.
ro. ἷοζέ). mest} similgntp the present
mus ve o cons occurrence,
as Plin. (1. l.) givesasatype of acommon-
place question ‘de ampliando numero
gladiatorum.. .consulebamur'.

5. Paetu- '.ll'hraeea, here first men-
tioned in the extant narrative. A tablet
found at Pompeii (see Mommsen in
Hermes», xii. 128) shows his full name to
have been ⁴1². Clodius Thrasea Paetus',
and that he was consul with Duvius (or
Dubius) Avitus (c. 54, 3) in the latter
months of Α. ι), 56. His name had been

previously supposed, from that of his

cetera per omnis imperii partis perinde egregia

daughter (see on 16. 28, 2), to be Fan·

nius.

6. arguendae sententiae, ‘sor blam-
ing his vqte' .cp. ‘arguens insolentiam
sententiae’ (3. 59, 2).

8. connecteretur. cp. c. 42, 6, on this
subjunct„ as also‘ suaderet dissuaderetve '
below (a correction os Lips. sor the infin.
in Med„ which Ritt. retainS, thinking
that‘ vellet' has dropped out aster‘ ve ⁹.)

9. res Romana contineretur, ‘on

continentur' the further change to
‘contineretur' is introduced by Halm
(with MS. Bud. ), and followed by Nipp„
Dr. Jacob. Ritt. reads‘ res Romanae
continentur’, supporting the plural by
referenceto6.14‚3;12.7,5;16.16,3,
διο. The indicative can stand, taken as a
parenthesis interposed in 'the oratio
obliqua (Introd. ι, v. 549).

attention to a question, and to ask that
it should be sormally brought before
the house by the consuls (⁶ relationem

OEAP. V] CONQUEST oF BRIJAJN [129]

The example of Augustus, and his precept against extension of the
empire‚² were no doubt a sufficient law to Tiberius, under whom the con-

tinuance of friendly relations is attested by the treatment of the shipwrecked
soldiers of Germanicus by British princes? The long ascendancy of
Cunobelinus (the Cymbeline os snakespeare), chief of the Catuvellauni, who
transferred his capital from verulam to the Trinovantian town of Camulo-
dunum‚³ and who must have been paramount‚ if not sole ruler of south
eastern Britain, from the later years of Augustus to almost the year of the
claudian invasion, was evidently a period of peaceful and commercia!
intercourse, and extension of Roman influence.⁴ It is moreover evident
tliat the immediate antecedents of the invasion are connected with the death
of Cunobeline and with the quarrels that ensued among his sons: one of
his sons, Adminius, is the fugitive whose surrender, with a few followers,
Gaius is said to have magnified into a national submission ⁸; Bericus or
Vericus‚ the suppliant to Claudius,⁸ may possibly have been another3
two others certainly are, as will be seen, the main objects of the attach,
and the leaders of the national resistancc.

Mommsen maintains that the occupation of Britain was necessary to
the security of Gaul, and must have been sooner or later undertaken.⁷
It is not, however, evident that the island Celts had been any source of

disquiet during the long period of peace ⁸ 3 though there seems to be some
reason to think that the detention of Adminius and Bericus was resented
as a grievance, and that some note of defiance was blown across the
ChanneL⁹ which may have had its share, with the remembrance of former
failure, in irritating the Roman pride Also, in such a ruler as Claudius,

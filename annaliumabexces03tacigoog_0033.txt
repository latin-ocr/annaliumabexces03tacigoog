and gisted brother was pushed sorward rapidly in public lise, and known
by only one redeeming trait, his early passion for study. Augustus
indeed, though by no means allowing him to make an exhibition of
himself in public, showed some regard for him in private life, and had
the insight to see that when he could command his facultieS, he was by
no means the fool he seemed¹t yet even he, though thus showing more
consideration than other and nearer relatives, was so far dissatisfied with
him as to allow him no other distinction than an augurship, and to give
him only a low position and trifling legacy in his wi11¹; while from the
stern and ungenial Tiberius he had less indulgence to expect. He was
now earnestly desirous of filling the magistracies of state, but was put off
with the ‘ ornamenta consularia ’ς a further request was met with the
contemptuous gift of a few gold pieces to spend at the Saturnalia⁸; and
he retired into shadow during the rest of this prince's rule, with no
further distinction than that of a place among the ‘ sodales Augustales ’. ⁴

pervading human affairs in all matters made evident to me. By repu-

to imperial dignity than he whom fortune was reserving in secret as the
future prince.'

Thus to the twenty-four years of childhood and youth under Augustus
are to be added twenty-two' more, passed in complete retirement under
Tiberius, in which, despised by those os his own rank, and bashsul in good

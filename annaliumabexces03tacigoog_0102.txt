cuae. 111] RULE OF NERO [89]

Tacitus has not lest us even a word os allusion to the last scene; but
as the narrative os all historiatas could only have res-ted on the testimony
of three or four eye-witnesses‚ it is not likely that the accounts materially
varied. He would no doubt have delighted to contrast the ghastly
irony, which at the last hour deplored „the loss to the stage,¹ and strove
even in its agony to bring out scraps of literature ² and forced efforts
ol' expression? with the serenity and sels-possession which had marked
the last hours of the tyrant’s most illustrious victims.

An important historical question remains to be considered, how far
the personal outrages and excesses of the emperor affected the general
administration of the empire. We have certainly no evidence of excep-
tional misgovernment‚ such as the universal disturbance os settlements
under GaiuS, or of such rampant venality and corruption as was preva-
lent under Claudius; nor, until the last year, is there evidence of any
general breakdown of authority. On the other hand, the reputation
gained in the first ‘ quinquennium '‚ overssmted, as we have seen reason
to think it has been‚⁴ is sar from being sustained throughout the later
period3 and we seem to have an impression of mingled wisdom and
weakneSS, as if Nero had been never without good advisers‚⁸ but
had either listened to them or followed his own impulse as the humour
took him. This may especially be illustrated by the strange interpo-
lation of the episode of Tigranes in the otherwise consistent policy
maintained throughout the Eastern war!⁸ The rebellion in Britain was
dealt with in a spirit of judicious conciliation ς’ the Jewish war was
taken up on a scale befitting its seriousness3⁸ but in neither case had
any previous account been taken of the widespread and deepseated
muses of discontent which had led to the outbreak. Again, in the
midst of that war, sor which assuredly all the strength available in
the East was needed, we hear of two projected expeditions‚ that to the
Caucasus, which perhaps at a more opportune time might have been

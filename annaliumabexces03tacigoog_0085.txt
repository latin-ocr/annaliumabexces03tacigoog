against a suspicion so slenderly supported.¹ The belief itself was less
an impulse of the moment² than an after-growth‚⁸ gathering strength no
doubt from the stories that he had pillaged the ruins,⁴ and from the
patent fact that he had seized all the best os the vast desolated area to
construet a palace on a scale previously unknown save perhaps in
Oriental history. The famous expedient by which this suspicion was to
be averted by fastening it on others, is treated os elsewhere⁸: our judge-
ment on Nero's own share in it will depend much on whether we believe
him to have been himself the incendiary, and deliberately to have sacri-
ficed those whom he had the best reason sor knowing to be innocent, or
to have been, like otherS, in the dark as to the real cause of the fire, and
to have believed tales which represented the Christians either as actually
its authorS, or as, from their ‘ hatred of the human race ',‘ likely to have
been so. In any case, history must record against him the reckless
eagerness with thch the charge was caught up, and the fiendish brutality
which turned the executions into a public amusement, such as shocked
even the hardened sense of those whose misgivings were to have been set
at rest by it!

To such ample reasons for alarin and indignation,⁸ other grounds of
discontent were contributing strength. The military disaster in Britain
and disgrace in the East ⁹ may have shaken the allegiance of the soldiers
to a prince who had little personal hold upon them, and whose star
seemed no longer in the ascendant: the popularity of Nero with the masses
must have received a check from the strong feeling at his ensorcement
of the cruel decree against the slaves of Pedanius Secundus,¹⁰ and from
the enthusiastic sympathy with Octavia,¹¹ and could be further under-
mined by keeping alive the belief ¹² that the catastrophe which had eost

would have disinclined him to take active part in a desperate venture;
and in. any case it is most improbable that he was privy to the inner
plot, if such there waS, to force a shortlived and dangerous greatness
on himself, at the eost of double-dyed treachery to his friend.¹

If the baser side of Seneca’s character has been throughout this
narrative presented oftenest,’ it is but just to notice how Tacitus, who is
certainly no blind admirer,⁸ brings out not merely his tenderness to
his wife⁴ and cheerfulness to his friendS,⁸ his dignified bearing and
almost inspired eloquence under the protracted agonies of death,⁸ but
also the steady composure with which he had looked sorward sor years to
such an end in prospect} and the simplicity of his ideas, as evidenced
by the asceticism of at least his later lise ⁸ and the instructions for his
unostentatious funeral, drawn up long ago in the days of his greatest
splendour.⁹

With Lucan, sar less sympathy has been felt, less perhaps than he has
actually deserved. Introduced in youth to the friendship os Nero,¹⁰ he
had ow'ed to court favour a quaestorship before the legal age, and a place
in the college of augum, and had won fame in the Neronia by a poetic
eulogy on his patron, pitched, we may be sure, in the same key as the
opening address in the Pharsalia, unrivalled in extant literature for
sulsomeneSS.¹¹ The first three Books of that Epic, probably the only
ones made known in his lifetime,¹² besides thus commending themselves,

ments may remind us of Vergil's address
to Augustus in the first Georgic; but
Lucan goes far beyond his predecessor.

1. sive coeperat, &a Nipp. thinks
it so remarkable that the obvious alter·
native suggestion (that Vettius meant
ironically to predict what was cominffz
is ignored, that he suggests the probab
loss, aiter ‘ lapsa ’, of such words as ‘ vei
oonsilio missa 3 but ‘in um vertit'
would hardly be said of au intentional
prediction. It is certainly probable that
, tem statem ’ is metaphorical3 as the
signi cauce of ‘coeperat' is hardly ob·
vious, unless the ‘species' described as
beginning to show itseli' can be supposed
to be the first rnmour of danger indicated
below. The conjectures of Lips. (⁴ ce·
perat', sc. ‘ animum ’) and Madvig Coeperat
eam speciem ’) seem needleas.

3. rumor, sc. ‘incedit' (cp. 1. 5, a),
supplied from ‘ incedunt ’.

4. cnara-‘nota’z ou this Tacitean
use cp. 1. 5, 4, and note.

promptum, with dat. cp. r. α, r, and
note: ou the ellipse of ‘ eum’, see Introd.
i. v. 8.

framentum· (see c. ι, 1): so all

ed ., aster Ber. for the Med. ‘facilianos ’.

dissimulando metu (repeated ¹⁵·
69, ο), best taken as dat. (cp. Introd. i.
ν. ς 32 b), but by some as abl. (see ¹4· 4)
8, and note). -Here Med. has ‘meu’i3
(the stroke being, according to Baiter, in
a later hand ‚ whence ‘metum’ is read
¹1²1}oe by Or i, and in both places by

6. ceteris . . . dilabentibus, besttaken
as abl. abs. Nipp. notes that it is implied
that Silius also was arrested3 Messalina
alone being excepted by the context.

9. consilium eximerent: cp. ‘ con-
stantiam exemerat’ (1. 32, 1). She had

no time to deliberate, but, as it were,
instinctively took this course (Nipp.).

10. intendit, ‘ makes up her mind' ε
thisverb issouaedwithinfiins. ¹²25?
aa, 5: so ‘oravit . . . adire’below (cp.6.
a, 3, aud note), and many other such uses
(Introd. i. v. ἱ 43).

misitque, ‘ and sent orders ’. This
correction of Halm has been erally
followed, and is supported by ng: 21, 1
(‘ mittitque legatos . . . ut . . . acciperent ’).
Med.has ‘missique' (the second ‘s’being
written above by a later hand). It is to
be su posed that her children were not
with er, but probably in the Palatium.

η. vetustissimam: assuchahewould
be ‘ virgo Vestalis maxima’ (see 2. 86, 1,
and note). N ipp. cites an inscription at
Athens (C. 1. Att. iii. 1. 875) referring evi·
dently to her as Περιὶν napum . . . lov
Οὗίρρωνος [θνγατέρα], and another (id.6o3)
to her father Ejlfrov Οὖιβίδιον Οὖίρρανα,
Dittenberger thinks (Eph. Epigd. 108) that
she was daughter of the person mentioned
in 2. 38, 3 (where the Med. text has
‘Varronem ’), and that, if so, she must
have become a Vestal before his expulsion
from the senate, i. e. at least thirty-four
years before the present date.

oravit, with int: cp. 6. a, 3, and
note.

pontiflci· maximi: cp. 3. 58, 4, &c.
she could most fitl demand audience
of the princeps in t is capacity. The
sacredness os the person os the Vestals
caused them to be osten employed as
intercesserat cp. Cic. pro Font. αι [17],

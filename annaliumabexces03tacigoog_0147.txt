a severe check, and the BritonS, though Togodumnus had now per-iahed,
appeared in no way dispirited3 whereupon Plautius, in accordance with
previous instructions», halted the whole army on the bank of the Thames,and
sent for further reinforcements¹ and for the presence of the emperor himself.

In this narrative, the most definite detail is the mention of the Boduni, and
it isa great question whether it is not also the most misleading. The name,
which is otherwise unknown, has been naturally taken to be an error of
transposition for that of the Dobuni, who in the time of Ptolemy had Cori-
nium for their town,² and must have occupied a district coinciding mainly
with Gloucestershire. This, added to the statement of Dio that the expedi-
tion sailed westward‚ led most modern critics to put the landing-places
considerably further west than would otherwise be supposed,⁸ and to take
the river at which the chief resistance was encountered to be as far distant
from the place of landing as the Gloucestershire Avon, or some other
stream in that part of the country.⁴ But on this supposition, the retreat
of the Britons from any such point to the south side of the estuary of the
Thames seems wholly inexplicable? If, on the other hand, we conclude,

Roman warfare. Caratacus was defeated) was near Sil-

than of the people (Evans, 134-139).

Das romische Heer, pp. 5²7-52 .

⁴ The place garrisoned (see agove) has
been taken to be Glevum (Gloucester);
which would on this supposition have
been the first position permanently occu-
pied by the Romans in Britain.

⁸ The view set forth by Dr. Guest, in
his treatise on the campaign of Plautius
(Origines Celticae, διο. ii. pp. 399, solt),
agrees in the main with that stated above
as to the direction taken, but differs on
some im ortant points. He thinks that
the l in was effected probably at
Richboroug , Dover, and Hythe, but

don, where his camp formed the first
permanent castellum, and where he does
not think that there is evidence of any
previous British settlement. He supporta
this viewfrom a passage in which Alfred
(who is su posed to have followed some
confused elsh Chronicle) ascribes to
Caesar a march somewhat resembling
the above (but stated as by way of Wal-
lingford to Cirencester) ς bnt the difficulties
involved seem extremely great. Plautius
could hardly be unaware that the head-
quarters of the resistame lay on the north
and north-east of the lower Thames, and
that the royal city of Cunobelinus was the
chief aim of the campaign
to make it hardly possible to suppose that
he would have allowed himself to be led in
awholly opposite direction to a point 160
miles from his only secure base, and would
have followed his enemy again thence
thmugh another long line of country, which

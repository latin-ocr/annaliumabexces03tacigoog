take up new winter-quartem in that country3 his own soree was not on a
large scale ²3 and the rabble of Paetus would not be an aid but an
incumbrance: still it is difficult to suppose that his instructions from'
home tied him as strictly as he implied, or that his position in Syria,
held by three nearly complete and thoroughly efficient legions, was as
much imperilled as he affected to apprehend.⁸

The year closes with the retirement of Paetus to winter in Cappadocia,⁸
and with an interchange of messages between Vologeses and Corbulo,
whereby the latter consented to destroy his outposts beyond the Euphrates,
on condition of the withdrawal of all the Parthian garrisons left behind
in various sortified places in Armenia.⁴ Thus all preparation sor offen-
sive movement was abandoned on both sides, and affairs seemed to have
dristed back once more into the position in which the arrival os Paetus
had found them ’ς but with the difference that Tiridates, the only prince
who could hold his own in Armenia by national support without ex·
ternal force, was more than ever master of the situation, and that
the prestige of victory had shifted altogether from the Roman to the
Parthian side.

The embassy which Vologeses had been ⁸ permitted to send ' ⁸ reached
Rome early in 816, Aa). 63? and exposed the hollowness of the gas-
conading dispatches of Paetus.⁸ The Parthian king spoke with just
pride of his success and clemency‚ and wrote as one who had to offer
terms instead of petitioning. The actual sovereignty os Armenia was
treated as no longer in question3 but Tiridates would consent to do
homage for it in presence of the symbols of the empire at the camp of
Corbulo, and would even have offered to come to Rome for investiture,
if it were not for a religious difficulty.⁹ The council of Nero,¹⁹ driven to
find some means of reconciling the facts of the situation with the satis·
faction os imperial honour, fastened on the last point as one on which
compliance might be extorted, so that they should not seem to have
accepted terms from the victor. Outwardly indeed, the Parthian pro-
posals were rejected in a spirit of defiance3 but the possibility of such
a compromise was understood to be implied in the conciliatory gists

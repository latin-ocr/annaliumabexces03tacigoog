worthy of note that Joscphus (Ant. so. 8, r)
declines to affirm with certainty that he
waps⁶ poisoned at all, saying only λόγος ἦν
sa τινων.

2. infusum, sc. ‘ ab Haloto ’ (c. 66, 5).
Suet. states that some accounts made it
the act of Agrippina herself.

delectabili boleto. [Med. has ‘ bo leto'
with ‘ci ’ in faded ink aud probably
by a different hand before ‘ bo , giving
‘ cibo leto’. Most edd. follow Jac. Gro-
novius in reading ‘cibo boleto'; but the
⁴ ei ⁹ is probably only due to a misunder-
standing οι the isolated ⁸ bo' of the
codex, aud it seems better with Wurm,
though not for· the reason he gives, to
discard ‘ cibo ⁹ and ιο read simply as above
⁸ delectabili boleto ‘.—F.] That the poison
was administered in a mushroom is
affirmed by a consensus of authorities:
see Suet. Cl. 443 Ner. 333 Dio, 1. 1.; Plin.
N. H. 22. 22, 46, 923 Martial, 1. 21, 43
Juv. 5, 147 ; 6, 620 (the two latter authors
confirming the account in Dio b speak-
ing of a single ‘ boletus '); and the witti·
cism of Nero, that mushrooms were
‘ deorum cibus ', is given by Suet. and Dio.
Only Tacitus and Suet. (see below ou ᾗ 3)
speak of any further subsequent adminis-
tration of poison. Τὴε mushroom is
thought to have been one of a kind
common in Italy aud known by the

names of‘ agar-icus Caesareus', ‘ agaricus
aurantiacus'. and ‘ amanita Caesaris : ’
see Lens, ⁴ Botanik der alten Griecheu
und Rdmer,’ p. 75³·

3. intellectam, sc. ‘a consciis '. If
however the followin words are so read
as to make the‘ soco ia’ that of Claudius
himself, it is possible, with Medvale, ιο
take these words to mean that its effect
was not felt: cp. ‘intellecto magis ae
magis . . . vulnere’ (Stat. Theb. ιι, 546).

socordiane, διο. The poison vras in·
teuded to affect the mind rather than the
life (c. 66, 3), but was expected to do
this at once. The fact that no effect was
perceived might have been dne to the
dulness of those watching furit, or to his
drunkenness, whereby the real condition
of the hrain could not be known. The
reading above is that of some of the oldest
edd. and of Halm, Nipp„ aud Dr„ among
moder-ns ι Med. has ‘ socordiane an Claudii
ui- an uiuoleutia ⁹, which Pich. defends,
bnt which has been generally taken to
coutaiu au error of repetition. Ritt. omits
the first ‘an·’ and takes ‘ui' to be the
corruption of some abbreviation of ‘ in·
certum ’ς while most others follow Rben.

the first ⁴ au ’ and ‘ ui '; iu both of which
readings ‘ socordia ’ is taken of the stupe·

following oue of the versions given by
Suet„ states that he at once collapsed
aud was carried off aud died the same
night, adding that he had been so often
carried off intoxicated that no suspicion
was exeited in the guests.

4. soluta alvus, dte. The same result
is meuticfimed in the case of Britannicus

13. 1 , ).
< 5. est quando, Sec. Here ‘ et ' couples
‘exterrita’ to the abl. abs. It would
hardly seem that an antithesis is intended
between ¹ ultima ' and ‘ praesentium ' ; for
the former can scarcely be taken, with

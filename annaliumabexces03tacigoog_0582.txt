quidem ille decernebat tamquam mortale fastigium egresso et
venerationem hominum merite, sed {pse prohibuit, ne interpreta-
tione quorundam ad omen malum sui exitus vertereture nam

desierit.

1. et venerationem, &a The whole
passage in Med. is hopelessly corrupt,
being thus read, ‘ et veneratio ite hominum
merito quorunda ad omia dolum sui exitus
uerteretur-‚⁹ For the first part the correction
of Rhea„ as above, is generally accepted,
unless ‘ et venerationem iam hominum
merito ’ (Ritt.) be referred: for the
latter part, it may assumed that a
lacuna exists‚ containing a sentence of
which Nero (as shown by the use of ‘sni’)
was the subject, and in which his refusal
of this honour must have been stated and
explained; but none of the attempta to
fin the ga and to adapt the remaining
words to e insertion have met with any

neral acceptance. Orelli simply marks
ἵε lacuna after ⁸ merito ⁹, and leaves the
Med. text obelizcd; others (also mar-king
the lacuna) correct ‘omina dolum' to
‘ omen ac dolum' (with Rhen.). The
conjectural restoration of Halm (whom
Dr. follows) is given in the text. Ritt.
marks the lacuna after ‘ quorundam ⁹, and
{iffi} „Tiffudfflidffniss‘ssffissiuffiffj
&a Nipp. (Ed. 4) limita the force of
*affianssetgohoffi ,mtuiclo'regggmffi
admonitu ad votum sui exitus verteretur ’,
taking these words as an ironical remark
of Tacitus, that Nero had certainly de·

served reverence at the hands of those

who suggested to him a desire for his own

death. Jacob reads ⁶ sed lpse prohibuit,

ne malignitate quorundam ad omen sni

exitus ac dolum verteretur ’. Many other

3. nam deum, &a Lips. compares
the saying of Tei-tullian (Apol. 34),
⁶ maledictum est ante a theosin deum
Caesarem nuncupare? uch statements
must however be understood in reference
to formal deification, with title of ‘divus',
by decree of the senate, and of public
worshi at Rome (see 1. 40, 8, and note;
13. 2, , and note), as distinct not only
from the temples in the provinces (see
note above), but also from local or private
worship in Italy and even in Rome itself
(see 1. 73, 2, and note), and from the
frequent ascriptiou of divine attributes to
the Caesar in the language of poets and
other courtiers, as well as from the hon-
ours paid to the effigy of the n'nceps in
camp (12. 17, 3, and note) an elsewhere
(3. 36, 1, and note). The more extra·

t honours allowed or claimed in
lifetime by Iulius Caesar (Suet. Iul. 76),
Caligula (Id. Cal. 22), or Domitian (Id.
Dom. 13), were not taken as a recedent.

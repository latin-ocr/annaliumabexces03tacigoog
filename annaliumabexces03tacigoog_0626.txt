dumque regem effusa, Thrasea occursu prohibitus non demisit
animum sed codicillos ad Neronem composuit, requirens obiecta
et expurgaturum adseverans si notitiam criminum et copiam

Β diluendi habuisset. eos codicillos Nero properanter accepit, spe
exterritum Thraseam scripsisse per quae claritudinem principis 5

3 extolleret suamque famam dehonestaret. quod ubi non evenit
vultumque et spiritus et libertatem insontis ultro extimuit, vocari
patres iubet.

3. expurgaturum, «ir. dp. in Tacitus
(who so uses ⁸ purgaturum ' in 4. 42, 2).
The verb is thus used, especially with

accus„ in the sense of clear-
ξέἓ one-eli, several times in Plant. and
Ter. and in Sall. Ing. 69. 4. Here we
should rather expect the full construction
to be‘etseea expurgaturum': cp. ‘non
facile est expurgatu’ (Ter. Hee. 2. 3, 4).

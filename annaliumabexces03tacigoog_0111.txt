been conceived on the grandest scale, and to have embraced no mere
effacement of past disasterS, but the creation of a great Roman empire
of the East, no less extensive than that of the Seleucidae, centred in
himself and in his children, and combined with his never-abandoned
scheme of supremacy in the West.¹ The preliminary steps had been
taken by securing the support of the Armenian king and bringing
the Iberian and Albanian tribes of the Caucasian region into a position
of dependence; Palestine was secured by aiding Herodes to expel Anti·
gonus ; in the enemy’s country the support of the powerful subject
Monaeses», probably also that of the king of Media Atropatene, was
reckoned on ; and the splendid army of sixteen legions, with other troops
making up a total of more than roo,ooo, with which Antonius at last
took the field, late in the season of 718, n.c. 38, was not unworthy
of the enterprise 3 but the vast scheme ended in ignominious failure
and a disastrous retreat, in which only the military genius of the general
saved his army from the fate of that of Crassus, With the shattered
temnant, nothing further was achieved in the following year than the
invasion of Armenia and seizure of its king Artavasdes, in punishment
for his desertion in the previous campaign. The impaired energies
of Antonius would probably in no case have been equal to further action
on a large scale ; and his dreams of Eastern empire were soon ended
by his fall and death. .

We can thus understand the situation which presented itself to his
rival aster the victory of Actium and the submission of Egypt left him
free to deal with it. Phraates, thoroughly hostile, and flushed with
recent victory, had been fortunately prevented from taking advantage
of the civil war by a temporary revolution which had driven him an
exile into Scythia before his rival Tiridates,² and was apparently just
then regaining his throne. Armenia, which had been in vassalage
sor a generation, was thoroughly alienated by the treacherous capture
of its king ς whose son Artaxias, after gaining power by national and
Parthian aid, had thrown away the scabbard, like MithridateS, by 3
massacre os all Romans within his dominions; and the work of Lucullus
and Pompeius would have had to be done over again, with such aid as
the petty surrounding kingdoms could furnisb.

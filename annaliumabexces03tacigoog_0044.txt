CHAP. 111] RULE OF CLAUDIUS [31]

Ptolemaeus had been summoned to Rome, and asterwards executed by
Gaius,¹ and had apparently lest no he'irs. His freedman Aedemon had
raised the standard of national independence, and had led into the sast-
nesses of Mount Atlas the wild tribesmen‚² many of whose fathers had
troubled the Romans already under Tacfarinas.⁸ Roman forces appear
to have been already sent against them by Gaius ‘3 but it was not till
the second year of Claudius that their subjugation was accomplished by
the able generals Suetonius Paulinus and Hosidius Geta ⁸ ; after which
the country was divided into two provinces under procurators,⁶ with
considerable military sorce,⁷ and the process of civilization and Romani·
zation begun under Augustus received a further impulse.⁸

It is, however, rather in the history of the European than of the
Asiatic or African provinces that the government of this prince constitutes
an era. In lun. 4⁶ the important kingdom of Thrace was annexed!
The circumstances which led to the change are unknown to us; but we
have sufficient evidence in past history that the kings set up by Rome
were here, as elsewhere, unable to command the obedience of their
subjects,¹⁰ and were only kept on their thrones by frequent interserence of
their protectors η, and that the direct government of part os the country,
under the form of wardship, had shared the usual sate of half measures ι’,
while the great value os the country as a recruiting ground was only to be
turned to account at the eost of insurrection.¹⁸ From 23-38 Aa). Thrace
had been virtually governed by a resident Roman officer. 111 the latter
year Gaius placed on the throne his friend and comrade Rhoemetalces,
a son of the former king Cotys. Rhoemetalces seems to have died
in 46 Α, n. without heirs, his kingdom lapsed to Rome, and was at
once ‘ reduced into the form of a province '. The annexation appears not
to have been accomplished without bloodshed,¹⁴ but to have been
thoroughly successful. The administration was entrusted to a procurator,¹⁸
who however was subject to the higher authority of the legate of Moesia
(as e. g. the procurator of Judaea to that of the legate of Syria), and
a garrison of two thousand troops ¹⁸· ,‘and hardly any province furnished

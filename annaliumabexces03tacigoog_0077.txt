him and Burrus of being cognimnt of the plot beforehand‚ a charge
doubtfully made‚¹ unsupported by evidence, and in itself improbable.
Men of that age and experience would hardly have caught at the
suggestion of the freedman, to get up a sham shipwreck on a calm night
in the bay of Baiae.

Thus died Agrippina, at the early age of sowy-three,⁸ at the bidding
of the son for whom her greatest crimes were perpetrated, after having
been for ten years the most prominent woman up to that date in all
Roman history. It may seem a fitting retribution that one who had
so blackened other reputations by her memoirs ⁸ should have the load
of her own sins aggravated by falsehood, and that the greatest known
intriguer should have been the victim of counter-intrigue3 nor has any-
thing but the atrocity of her murder won sympathy for one whose end
was otherwise but a fitting climax to her life.

1t excites surprise that full three years should have intervened before
the murder of Agrippina was followed by the divoree of Octavia and
marriage of Poppaea. But few qualities are more remarkable in Nero
than his timidity‚ and the manner in which he felt his way from crime
to crime, as if to ascertain gradually how far he could safely venture.
In the present case, the realization of his own chief longing, the public
exhibition of his accomplishments‚ though tentative and gradual, yet in
some form began at once3 but the elevation of Poppaea from mis-
tress to lawful wife, an object of far more interest to her than to
himself, was so delayed as to make her fear that she had intrigued
in vain. It was not till his shy, quasi-private appearance as a cha-
rioteer in his gardens⁴ had been succeeded by his entry on the stage
at the Juvenalia,⁸ not till the adverse murmurs at the institution
of the Neronia· had been somewhat sileneed by the experience of
it,·¹ not till the opportune death of Burrus had plaeed the command
of the praetorians in safer handS,⁸ and Seneca had retired with
shattered influence into half privacy,⁹ not till the dangerous Rubellius
Plautus had followed Sulla into exile ¹⁰ and both had after an in-
terval been put to death‚¹¹ not till he saw these and all his other
atrocities regarded as matters of public admiration and enthusiastic

rej0icing‚¹’ that he had courage to turn over another page in his
domestic history.²¹

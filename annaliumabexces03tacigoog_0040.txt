CHAP. 111] RULE oF CLAUDIUS [27]

senate as a whole by the deference paid to its authority.¹ It was to be
consulted on all matters os state,¹ as in former times; even the restoration
of exiles was submitted to its approval,’ and the allowance of a small
guard of honour to the emperor within its precincts was asked as a
favour ⁴: and not only at the outset, but throughout his 'rule‚ he shows
himself desirous to keep up the dignity of that body, by purging it
of unworthy members,⁸ and by infusing into it new and healthier blood ⁶
from the ranks below? and even from provincial sources.⁸ A similar
recrniting‚ later in the course of his rule, of the ranks of the patriciam?
would make it easier to fill the few priestly offices still confined to that
body.¹⁰ Other acts, extending to all ranks alike, were probably in effect
an especial boon to the upper classes. The law of ‘ maiestas '‚ by which
Tiberius had decimated the senatorial and equestrian aristocracy, was
allowed to sink into oblivion,¹¹ and the princeps solemnly swore that no
Roman citizen should be put to torture.¹² It was no doubt by these and
other similar measures that Claudius won a permanent place among
constitutional ‘ principes 2²⁸ and earned the title of ‘libertatis vindex 2¹⁴
while he compensated the lower orders for the curtailment of the great
shows and largeaees of Gaius ¹⁸ by the gradual abolition of his imposts,¹⁸
and by this and other means gained no slight popularity.²⁷

Important regulations were also made in the administration of the
finances of the empire‚ which must have become altogether disorganized.

In respect of the ⁸ aerarium publicum '‚ it was perhaps a mere stroke
of antiquar-ianism to transfer the charge from praetore to quaestors ς nor
was the change beneficial‚ except so sar as it substituted selection for
the haphazard of the lot, and allowed time to gain experience by pro·
longing the tenure of office.¹⁸

anP. v] CONQUEST OF BRITAIN ·

[149]

cannot be even approximately given 3 but it is reasonable to suppose
that among the earliest localities to be occupied were the great road
centreS‚ as Canterbury‚ Silchester, winchester, Cirencester,¹ and a place
possessing such a gift of nature as Baths It is probable enough that
some at least os these places had received their first Roman settlers ⁸
before or during the ten years of rest which preceded the next movement
of conquest under the legati os Vespasian.⁴

¹ Among these, the most open cite, 2. 3,
and that which has been most explored,
is Silchester, which had a strongly walled (ltin.) ‚ generally taken to be an error sor
circuit of irregular- poly onal (ap roach· ‘ Aquae Sulis’, as there is evidence that

foundations os a forum, double basilica,
and other buildings, forming a rectangle
os some 3²0 by 280 feet, have been dis·

rincipal object within it would be the
amous batha, the remains of which
(though now onl partially brought to
li ht) are probab y the most important
τέ ies os the Roman period yet found in
ritain.
³ lt should be mentioned that in all the
several cases noted above, the estimates
given os the areas appearing to be enclosed
y Roman walls are only to be taken as
evidence os the character and importance
of the places at the date os such enclosure 3
which date must be determined by other
consideratione, and cannot be assumed
to be that of their first settlement.

the victims as not Jews but Christiana. The earliest exproes reference
to any Neronian persecution in a Christian writer is that in the fragment
preserved by Eusebius ¹ of the Apology addressed to M. Aurelius by
Melite, Bishop of Sardis, about ΑΛ). 170, which, without showing any
knowledge of the circumstances as described by Tacitus, sets forth me
two most wicked emperors, Nero and Domitian, as having become, at
the suggestion of evil counsellors, the only persecutors os the Christiana·
The same note is dwelt upon at greater length by Tertullian, who,
though he refers his adversaries to the statements of their own writers,
and has elsewhere⁸ distinctly cited TacituS, shows no knowledge of this
passage of the Annals.⁴ By others, as LactantiuS‚⁸ Eusebius,‘ and
Jerome‚‘' Nero is spoken os in general terms as a persecutor, with no
allusion to these many and nameless victims, but as having caused the
martyrdom of St. Peter and St. Paul; and it is in Sulpicius Severus
alone that any unmistakable following of the narrative of Tacitus is
shown.¹⁸

There remain also to be noticed allusions in two Christian books of
earlier date than that of Tacitus and Suetonius, which, without containing
the name of Nero, or referring indisputably to this massacre, seem
difficult to be explained or understood without supposing some distinct
reference to it.

The least open to question is that in the first Epistle of St. Clement to
the Corinthians, which is with probability taken to have been written in or
about the last year os Domitian,⁸ and which appears distinctly to aliu&

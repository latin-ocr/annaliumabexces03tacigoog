cuAP. IV] PARTHJA ΛΝΒ ARMENJA

[τοι]

Armenia a province, and merely gave it back as an act of grace to a
native prince: ‘ Armenia Capta,’ or ⁶ Recepta,’ appears on coins ²3 and the
achievement there of Tiberius is ranked with the subjugation by Agrippa
of Cantabria ἐ the surrender of the standards is no less commemorated
in triumphal medals,⁸ and may well have figured on many an Augustan
work of art,⁴ as it does on the noblest of this emperor’s extant statues ⁸:
poetry ranks it with the great military glories of Rome,⁸ pictures the ”
trophies as ‘torn away'⁷ by the victor’s hand, the great rivers of the
East as flowing in humbler stream? and even Phraates as prostrated
at the knees of Caesar to do homage for his throne.⁹ Ten yearS,¹⁰
or even thirty years later,²¹ the same subject is still an appropriate theme
for compliment.

Phraates continued outwardly to show ‘ all service of reverence ’,ι’ and
cemented the alliance some ten years later by sending all his legitimate
family to be domiciled in Rome31⁸ a step fruitful in consequences by
supplying for many a year to come a stock os Romanized princes of the
blood to be set up as claimants for the throne. During the latest years
of Augustus, Roman influence seemed to have reached its highest point,
when the first of these princeS, Vonones, was formally summoned and

a triumphal arch or ehariot is repre-
sented. The statement of Dio (54. 8, 3)

rect, as e only two occasions mentioned
in Mon. Ane. 1. 2ι are otherwise ac-
counted for3 but it is doubtlesa one of
the occasions on which such an honour
vas offered and declined.

⁴ A triumphat arch was erected in the
Forum (see Momma. R. G. D. A. 125,
127) ς and the great temple of Mars Ultor
in the Forum A ‘ was built to receive
the standarda (Mon. Anc. 5.42, and notes),
which had been at first deposited in the

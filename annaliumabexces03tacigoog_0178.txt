CAP. 7, 8 ιι

idemque Mithridatis frater nuntiabat discordare Parthos sum-
8 maque imperii ambigua, minora sine cura haberi. nam Gotarzes

eius paraverat, unde metus [eius] in ceteroS, et accivere Vard-

4 anen.

ille, ut erat magnis ausis promptus, biduo tria milia 5

stadiorum invadit ignarumque et exterritum Gotarzen proturbat;
neque cunctatur quin proximas praefecturas corripiat, solis

‚opibns· is repeated from H. 4. 6ι, 2.
ep. ‘fisos loco‘ (4. 25, ι).

1. summa imperii ambitus, ‘the
throne itself was in dispute; whatever
vas less important (as Armenia) was

. treated carelessly' ι so ‘externa sinecura
habebutur’ (H. 1, 79, 1).

read‘ nam inter Gotarzis' ,retaining‘ qui’
aud omitting‘ et’ before‘ accivere', soas
to make the latter word the principal
verb, and‘ qui necem. .'ceteros paren-
thetical. Ritt. inserts ‘infensos before
‘’,inter and alters‘ qui’ to‘ atque’. Pfitzn.
alters‘ inter' ιο ‘interim’ ,⁸and qui' (aster
Madvig) ιο 4 uin'. The way in which
the names os otarzes and Vardanes are
here introduced would either imply that
they had been already mentioned, or
would support Madvig's theory (Adv. ii.
550) that a lacum exists, and that a sen-
tenoe beginning with‘ nam inter Gotar-
zem' had given some account of the
original contention for the throne, and
had gone on to speak of‘ Gotarzis plera-
que σπη’, and that the scribe had skipped
from one mention of the name to another.

censor os Artabanus 111. (on whom see 2.

biduo, in forty— —eight hours. The
whole space is 375 Roman (nearly 350
English) miles; and the rate of progress,
averaging over seven English miles for
every hour, must be im ible for an
army, even though whol y consisting of
horsemen.1f we suppose him to have
come with a few followers, and by relays
of horses, the rate is the same as that of
Hannibal from Zama to Adrumetum (App.
Pun. 47), and less than that of Tiberius
to his brother Drusus (Pl. N. H. 7.2
8 4). Α critic, cited by Walther, as also
Kritz (see Halm, Not. Crit.), sugg ests that

‘triduo duo millia' should be read.
6. invaditis traverses’, οι ‘leaves be·
hind him. The word is nowhere else

recisely thus used; but the sense is ana·
fageus to that of occupying a country (6.
31, 2), gaining possession of an army
(H. 4. 68, 4), οι the empire (15. 52, 3),

pied in sodoing. Thegger ilian‘ invade

pares, seems ιο have a different meaning.
The conjectures ‘evadit’ (Heius),‘ per-
vadit’ (Haase), seem needless.

were styled βίστακες, οι ‘vitaxae’ (see
Momms. Hist. v. 344ς Ε. T. ii. 6). The

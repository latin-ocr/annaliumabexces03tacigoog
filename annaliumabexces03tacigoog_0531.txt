(⁴ fessa aetate sut rudis pueritiae aetas’)
would oblige us to suppose that Tacitus
either used such an expression ss ‘ fessa
aetate aetas’, 01· that he has coordinsted
with ⁶ lamenta feminarum ' an abl. os
qualit . and then a nominative (‘ rudis
aetas'g. A single inferior MS. (Agr.)
gives ‘senum’ for ‘aetate ’, which hos

would be extremely har-eh, and it my
seem somewhat less objectionable to sol·
low Orelli and others, who adopt, from
Lips„ the excision of ‘ aetate ’ ns a gloss;
and to suppose that both clauses are
nominativa, a'nd that ‘ ima aetas' is lest
to explain itself, and ⁸ rudis’ is explained
by ⁶ pueritiae’. It is also possible to take
‘ aetas rudis pua-itise’ (εἰῶ Pfitzner) as
coordinating a genit. of qualit with the
nom. ‘sesss’. Haase would et or
omit both ‘ aetate? and‘pueritine’. The
expression ‘fessa ’.ω’ is one of which
Tacitus is fond (cp. 1. 46, 33 3. 59, 6;
ἶ ,4,,ἕ’,ἒιὲ, 51¹3 ἔῑέἐοέἐ, &⁶3⁷’53'2 2¹2¹}
it is certainly difficult to su pose 111111 in
any of these emendations e true words
of Tacitus are restored to us.

their escaping at uncertain points (‘ vaga
efl'ugia’)‚ and leave them no landing
point but that at which they embarked.

soldiers). an are spoken os as ‘ occupying
the rest of the lake with decked ships·
(⁴ tectis navibus ’ ε ναυσὶ καταφράκτοις).
Professor Holbroolte, however, thinks that
an additional guard is meant consisting of
ships manned by marines, to command the
parts of the lake where there were no rafts.

The ‘chlamys' (cp. Verg. Aen. 4, 137)
was a Greek gar-ment, nearl the same
with the ‘ paludamentum’ (see lin. below,
and Momms. Staatsr. i. 432, 5), and the
epithet given to it b Dio and Tacitus is
to be explained b liuy‚ who, speaking

fortium virorum animo. Suet. gives
a different story3 that when Claudius
answered their salutation (⁸ have impe·
rator, morituri te salumt ’) with ‘ant
non ', they took it as a par-dou and refused
to fight3 that his first thought was to
massacre them all, but that afterwards
by himself going round, and threaten·
or encouraging them in an undiguifi
manner, he forced them to fight.

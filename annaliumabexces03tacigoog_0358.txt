A. D. 56] LIBER XIII. CAP. 28-30 191

Augustus senatui permisit deligere praefectos; deinde ambitu
suffragiorum suspecto, sorte ducebantur ex numero praetorum
2 qui praeessent. neque id diu mansit, quia sors deerrabat ad
parum idoneos. tunc Claudius quaestores rursum imposuit
iisque, ne metu offensionum segnius consulerent, extra ordinem
honores promisit: sed deerat robur aetatis eum primum magi-
8 stratum capessentibus. igitur Nero praetura perfunctos et

experientia probatos delegit.

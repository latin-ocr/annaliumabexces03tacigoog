The boy, with his brothers and sisters, shared the triumph of his
father ¹, was one of the two with him at his death in Syria, and followed
the mournfiil procession of his mother with the remains.² After this,
Tacitus makes no mention οἱ him for several years, during which time
we are told by Suetonius that he was under the tutelage first of his
mother, then of his great- -grandmother Augusta,n and, aster the death of
the latter, under that of his grandmother Antonia.

The far· -reaching aims os Seianus are stated to have included a plan
sor his assassination at the same time with that of Tiberius. ⁴

He assumed the toga virilis at a later age than his brothers 3ηά with·
out the distinctions granted to them ⁸· , and then or soon afterwards
received in marriage Junia Claudilla, daughter of M. Silanus, and accom-
panied Tiberius to Capreae,⁸ where most of his next four years were
spent, years which must have done much to form his character. We are
to think os him as at once schooling his violent and impulsive temper ⁷
to live under the suspicious glauce of those penetrating eyes, as ‘ veiling
' the ferocity of his spirit under a mask of submission ’,⁸ and ‘learning
every artifice of salsehood in the intimacy of his grandfather ’.² The
successive stages in the fate os his mother and brother failed to elicit a
word from his lips 3ηά appeared to make no impression on his mind:
his one aim from day to day was to study the mood of Tiberius and
adapt every word 3ηά look to it 3 so that the witticism spread that ‘ never
was there man who would be a better slave or a viler master ’.¹⁰ Tiberius,
who himself had under Augustus passed through a similar period of
disguise 3ηά repression, while to outward appearance satisfied with his
submissiveness, was not likely to be really deceived by it. He gave
him no higher magistracy than the quaestorship ¹¹ (carrying with it
admission to the lowest rank of senators), 3ηά no other mark of honour
but the pontificate ¹¹, and not seldom let sall expressions which showed

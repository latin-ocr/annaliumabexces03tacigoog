cmv. v] CONQUEST 'oF BRJTAJN [139]

steps in the direction of conquest was the honour of an ovation,¹ other-
wise as jealously reserved for the imperial family as the greater triumph
itself.⁸

With the appointment of his successor P. Ostorius Scapula, in 800,
lun. 47, we recover the guidance of Tacitus3 but it cannot be said that
we gain from him any clear conception of the military movements. We
have rhetorical descriptions of battles and vague geography, reminding
us of that of the campaigns of Germanicus: nor have we even, as we have
usually in the Annals, the means of distinguishing the campaigns of
successive years.⁸ η

We are told that the new legatus, on his arrival late in the season‚⁴
had at once to deal with raids by the unsubdued tribes upon those within
the province. Not content with chastising the raiders, Ostorius resolved
to present such disturbances of the Roman peace by annexing a consider·
able district, probably that now included in the Midland Counties.⁸ This
annexation at once ‘excited alarm among the Iceni on the east, the
Brigantes in the north, and the Welsh tribes in the west.

It was only however from the latter that at this stage any serious
opposition was encountered. But on the Welsb border the atrise was
long and bitter. For the remaining three years or more of his rule and
lifetime‚ Ostorius is engaged in the struggle, destined to last till the time
of the Flavian emperors,⁸ against the desperate resistance of North and
South Wales. At the opening of our- narrative these are united under
the heroic leadersbip of CaratacuS, who, aster the wreck of his inherited
domiuion in the East‚‘¹ had thrown himself into this stronghold of national
independence‚ and won confidence by many successful and drawn battles

cnsp, iv] PARTHIA ΛΝΒ ARMENIA [117]

planation os this turn of events is open to us; and' it is hardly worth·
while to speculate whether Corbulo may have soreseen circumstances
likely to make the retention os Tigranocerta during the winter imprae-
tioeble, or whether, being aware, as he must have been, that ,no other
ultimate solution than the recognition of Tiridates was possible, he
desired either to win the credit of accompIIshing it before his
successor arrived, or to leave him to sace the responsibilities arising
out of its rejection.¹

The spring of 815, Aa). 62, brought with it the rejection of the
Parthian embassage,⁸ and the arrival os L. Caesennius Paetus in
Cappadocia,⁸ bringing with him, either as his instructions from Rome,

or as a vaunt on his own part, another change of policy, that Armenia ἡ

should be freed from puppet kings by becoming a Roman province.⁸
It might be not much more costly to effect this object than permanently
to keep up Tigranes3 but such slight national support as that prince
could command could no longer be counted on, and his threat ’ in
any case was idle, unless an addition of two or three legions to the
normal military establishment was contemplated. Our record of his
first and only effort to re-occupy and hold the country, is little more
than an elaborately contrasted portrait of the two generals; th'e one,
cautious and vigilant, strengthening carefully the defences on the
Euphrates, pushing his outposts gradually into the hostile country,
and assuming so sormidable an attitude as to make any attack on
his position evidently hopeless ⁸ 3 the other, a braggart in success,
'and a coward in the sace of disaster, starting, in defiance os what
are made to have been the plain warnings of the god8,⁸ with ¹an ex·
travagant design, abandoning it sor desultory plunder,⁷ and prematurely
(as it would seem ⁸) retiring to the inaction of a winter camp, yet
wording his dispatches as if the whole kingdom lay at his feet,⁸ and,

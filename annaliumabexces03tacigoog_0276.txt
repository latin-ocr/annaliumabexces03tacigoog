Borghesi (OEuvres, vi. 159) shows is to
be read ‘ C. Antistio Vetere, T. Manlio
Valente eos ².

3. auctaque et, διο. The sentence
is no doubt awkward and ill-arranged:
Nipperdey alters ‘et’ into ‘est’, thereby

etting rid os some of the difficulty:
fletuum suggest ‘ aeque ’ sor ⁸ atque ',
while Jacob ests that ‘et’ and ‘ atque ⁹
answer to ea other, as perha in
Did. 14, 3 (‘ et sermo . . . atque id psum
delectat’), and Suet. Cl. 21 (⁴ et tophina

answers to ⁸ apud hostes ’ς the sense
being as is the words ran thus ‘ auctaque

restoration of ‘e Brigantum ⁹ for the Med.

mention of Cartimandua (c. 36, 1), and
from the Histories (1. 1.). No other

10. &animost adivoree’ (2.86,2; ιι.

stated that the wealth and prosperity
which flowed in to her from her service
to the Romans in the betrayal of Carata-
cus led her to reject Venutius, and to
take in his stead his ‘armiger’, Vellocatus,
so as to make herself in fact sole ruler;
but that the nation took the side os the
injured husband, and that she was reduced
‘ in extremum discrimen ⁹.

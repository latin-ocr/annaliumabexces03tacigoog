Barea Sorano, only mentioned pre-
viomly as cos. design. and as voting
a reward to Pallas (11. 53, 1). His gen·
tile name appears to be Marcius (see note
there). He was at this time advanoed in
*years (e. 30, 4). His son-in·law (l. 1.),
Annius Pollio, bad been already exiled
for his supposed share iu the conspiracy
of Piso (15. 71, 6). His name ia conpled

Canus and Seneca as m to their

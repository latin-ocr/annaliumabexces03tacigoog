[80] INTRODUCTION [cunr. 111

Many of the conspirators, and os those who perished subsequently,
had few claims, or none whatever, on general sympathy3 and even the
highest ranked in elevation of character below Thrasea and Soranus,
to whose sate Tacitus has given more space than to that of any others
among the Neronian victims.¹ Yet, with all that is told us, much is still
left obscure and unexplained3 and the real causes which led Nero to
compass 'their destruction are mainly matter of conjecture.

Thrasea, though undoubtedly the leader os the extreme section of the
senatorial ‘ Opposition ',⁸ and a man os longstanding and pronounced
republican sympathies, had been enabled, although a ‘ novus homo '
from Patavium,⁸ to go through the course os magistracies and attain the
consulship,⁴ and could not therefore have been always obnoxious to
emperors. In the early years of Nero, when his attendance in the
senate was constant,⁸⁵ various servile motione had elicited from him
no word of protest:⁸ and those who had expected greater things had
murmured at the waste of his strength on trifles⁷; while even his one
strong step, that of rising and leaving the house when thanksgivings and
congratulatione were decreed on Agrippina's death,⁸ receives scant
praise from Tacitus? Three years later, at the trial of Antistius,¹⁰ he
appears as a skilsul tactician‚ leading the majority of the senate in a
course opposed to Nero's secret purpose, but fully within the terms of
the question,¹¹ and veiling his opposition under well-chosen compliments ¹²3
while his only subsequent recorded speech,¹³ if conceived in a narrow
spirit of Roman pride, could yet have been in no way unacceptable to the
court.¹⁴ It would seem likely that he had been driven into more pro-
nounced hostility by the ascendancy of Poppaea, and that his three years
of continuous absence from his place in the senate ¹⁸ had begun at the
date of the vows and thanksgivings at the birth of her child.¹· It is

she advanced her own position and that of her ιιοῐι.ι She amasses
wealth first and soremost 3 ¹ for in that age every man had his price :
the recall and advancement of Seneca⁸ gives her the popular position of
a protectress of culture,⁴ and the most brilliant writer and most versatile
politician of the day as her ally. Above all, she takes care to secure a
far stronger interest, by obtaining the command of the praetoriana sor
her nominee? The outward marks of ascendancy come in due course.
She is the first emperor’s wife to receive the title of ‘ Augusta' ⁸, the first

whom a colony is named ε ⁸ at the pageant of Caractacus ⁰ and the open-

reconciled nor supplanted, was at the emperor's side, and was organizing
a fresh intrigue ¹⁷ with the same steady purpose which had struck down
Messalina in the plenitude of her power. He had personally nothing
to hope from Britannicus, whom he had probably joined with others in
supplanting ; ¹⁸ but he was menaced by still more imminent danger from
Agrippina and her son: while Claudius lived he was safe, and it was
only on the latter side that the life of Claudius was threatened.¹⁸ Hence
he bent all his energy to undo the past, to restore the emperor's
affection for his son by blood, and to destroy the intruders. Agrippina’s
first attempt to attach him through the sailure of the Fucinus tunnel⁹⁰ had
evidently sailed, and his prompt counterchange ²¹ had probably lodged

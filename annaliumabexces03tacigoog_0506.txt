1. nuntii. There is some harshness
in supplying ‘ expostulabant ⁹ from the
next semence, on which account Ritt.
reads ⁶ Vol ’ and ‘ missis nuntiis’
(with only a comma aster ‘ faceret ’), and
also {mgna to alter ‘expostulabat' to
the ur .

agemont eatena. The verb is
robably best taken (with Gerber and

reei') in the sense of ‘ dirueret' (cp.
⁸ diruta ' below),as in H. 4. 64, 3 (⁸ muros
. . . detrahatis '). Dr. takes it as a new
phrase, analogous to the use os the word

' of withdrawing troops, διο. The forts
are those mentioned in c. 9, ας υ, 1.

2. diversis-‘hostilibus’5 so ‘diversa
πῖθ’ (¹3· 57, ὃς 14 30,1),&c. ,

3. expostulabatst· postulabat' as in
1212 ³130 22⁸0 12⁸⁶} ‘33³¹‘ :00:321 ²33
different sense) 'in ὀ. 5, 1., ἷΡοεωῙῶ
takes this construction iu Cic. , &c.

5. eine arbitro, ‘without interfereuce ’ς

. ‘mortem sine arbitro‘ (16. 11, 6);

1. 26, 6, and note.

6. tropaea: ep. 2. 18, 2, and note.

aremus, bly that which had
been {leci-ced our years previously (13.
41, 5 ·

7. integro adhuc beno, ‘while the
war was yet undecided‘; so in H. 2. 57,
1 (ln 2. 46, ι, the meaning is different):
cp. ‘ rebus integris· e. 25, 1.

8. dum avectus, δια, ‘inasmuch as

true, that the rated dispazches of
Ptetus ‘quasi co o bello (c. 8, 3)
had been believed and perhaps still further

m²8¹¹1fied: the nem of his su nent
reverses was not received until the fo low·
¹1²8 ⁸Pfl¹3g (c. 24„ 1); so that the ‘neque
turn omma’ is altogether unsalr.

9. dissimulandi· . . . cuns, gerundivo
dat. (Introd. i. v. 5 22 b), ‘to conceal
his auxiety about foreign affairs! This
imputation os motive again is wholly
gratuitous; nor could an disaster, or

numentum plebis. The context
shows that this was stored not for ·
tuitous distribution, but for sale at a ow
rate; it being part of the ‘ cura annonae ‘
to regulate prices, not only by sale from
public stores, but also iu dear times by
com ting merchants sor selling below
mar et value. (See c. 39, 231. 2, 2; 2.
87, 1, and notes.) All costs connected
with the ⁸ frumentum publicum ’ were
borne formerly by the ‘ aerarium ', espe-
cially, uo doubt, by the revenues οἱ the
senatorial provinces of Sicily, Asia, and
Africa, but a pear from the time of
Claudius or ero to have been trans-
ferred to the ‘fiscus’ generally, and under
the Flavian Caesars to a special ‘fiscus
frumentarius ⁹. See Hirschfeld, Untersuch.
p. 6132; also Marquardt, Staatsv. ii. pp.
12 , 133.

11. sustentaret, i. e. to keep u the
confidence res ting plenty whle the
public had ffiffio felt, by· leading them
to believe that there must be abundance
of ood corn iu store. Nipp. follows
Ry . and others in reading ‘ostentaret’
(aster MS. Agr.), taking ‘securitatem'
to mean ‘safety’ (i. e. ‘assured abun·
dance’), as in 11. 31. 2 (‘securitati .. .
consulere'); Agr. 3, 1 (‘ securitas pub-
lica’); Plin. N. H. 28. 2, 4, 21 (‘securi-
tatem itinerum’). The alteration per-
haps gives a better sense, but is hardly
maiiix? &tarnem

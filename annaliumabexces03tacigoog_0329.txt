whose kingdom he ap rs subsequently
to have possessed (Id. . I. 7. 7, 4). He
is the last recorded vassabking of Lesser
Armenia (on which see 1 1. 9, 3, and note),
which appears to have become part of
the provincial empire under Vespasian
(Momms. Hist. v. 299, 1 3 Ε. Τ. i. 324, 1).

2. Sophenen, a tract on the south-
west of Armenia, between Mt. Masius
and Anti-Taurus (Strab. 11. 14, 2, ⁵²7)
and separated by the Euphrates from
Cap ocis. Strabo (1. l.) mentions its

dione abscessit’ (Id. 37. 31, 3). In 1. 7,

a preposition.

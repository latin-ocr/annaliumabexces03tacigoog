by previous emperors to the Jews are sully guaranteed,¹ and insults to
themselves and their religion, such as a subsequent edict of PetroniuS,
legate of Syria,¹ shows to have been even afterwards prevalent, were
forbidden. The waming added in one of these edicts to the Jews thern-
selves shows that they also had similarly transgressed, and throws light
on another act ol' opposite spirit, whereby the Jews in Rome itself (their
only considerable settlement in the west ⁸) were punished sor some act of
turbulence by expulsion‚⁴ or at least by inhibition from exercise of their
worship.⁸ This edict of intolerance would however seem to have been
(as in a former case under Tiberius ⁸) only temporarily or partially
carried out.⁷

In Armenia, the position held under Tiberius was reestablished by
releasing⁸ and sending back Mithridates, the king originally chosen by
him? who was enabled by the tempor-ary wealtness of Parthia to recover
and maintain his authority.¹⁰

The appointment ol* another Mithridates to the kingdom os Bosporus
was less sucoessful.¹¹

In Commagene, the wiser arrangement of Tiberius, who had consti-
tuted it as a province,¹⁸ was not reestablished, but Antiochus, whom Gaius
had made king of the country but afterwards deposed and detained at
Rome, was sent back.¹⁸ The other vassal kings whom it had pleased
Gaius to set up, such as Cotys of Lesser Armenia,¹⁴ Sohaemus of Ituraea‚¹⁸
were left in possession. In another corner of Asia, the small free state
of Lycia paid the penalty of its turbulence and anarchy in the loss of its
independence,¹‘ a change which resulted in its complete Hellenization.¹'

The Rhodians soon afterwards suffered a similar penalty, but only
tempomrily.1⁸
In Mauretania, a restoration of the former state was impossible.

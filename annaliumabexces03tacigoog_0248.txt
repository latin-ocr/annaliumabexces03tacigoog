retained b most edd. and defended by
. H. Mul er (Beitr. iv. ιο); the clause

‘ taken as depending on some such
idea as ‘visum est ⁹, supplied from ‘ asper·
nati sunt'. But such passages as are re-
ferredto (e. .3.68, ις 71,3; H.4.5,1)
are not re y rauel, and a sentence
so complete in itself as that here given
(‘quod . . . arduum ³) would hardly be
thus awkwardly followed by a final clause.
It is possible that some participle has
dropped out, but Ritter's insertion of
aaut? ..zaetas aaran&
clauae has got out of its place, and should
stand after ‘ signum caedis '‚ or to follow
Em. with Halm and Ni p„ in treating
‘nt’ as the insertion o a scribe who
thought such a construction necessary,
and to take the sentence as the expression
os a thought (ι let them rather perish by
right of warfare') with the verb of think-
ing omitted (see Introd. i. v. 5 38 a).
The transition is somewhat harzh, but
lessso than if ‘ut’ were altered to ‘at'
(with Haase).

tenets as would make the charge seem plausible.¹ It may be added
that the reference (if such it may be taken to be) to this event in the
Epistle of St. Clement² represents the martyrs as victims to party spiri
or jealousy (ζῆλος).“ The argument from silence,⁴ resting on the
absence of any mention of this among all the acts of hostility imputed
to the Jews by Christian controversialists, loses much of its weight by
the generality of the language used in most of the places referred to.

We should infer from Tacitus that the general guilt of the Christian
body was assumed in some way before any individuals were dealt vith;
and that the openly known and professed Christians were but a sunl}
section of the whole body,⁸ and that it was through some, perhaps
very few of the former, probably under terrible constraint of tor-ture,
that the latter were got at.⁶ Those who know the flimsy evidence that
has generally been held to suffice in such mockeries of justice as timet
of intense public excitement sanction, will readily understand that
membership in a body of pronounced ‘ haters of mankind' seemed proof
enough of incendiarism ⁷ at the tribunal, perhaps of the city praefect,
or at that where Nero, with probably Tigellinus at his side,⁸ presided.
Nor do even the bitter words used by the historian forbid us to suppose
that he sympathized with the general feeling expressed at Nero's bruta]

⁸ This could equally refer to betrayal

mentioned that yMelito see,above p. 422,

as if promt ted by ordinary individual

body. This may be intended especially
to refer to the latter emperor.

the allusion which* rs thought to be made
to the subject in Juv.1,1 5, brings ia
the name of Tigellinus,w whose nannai
position would have been that of assessor

siding at torture (1460, 4). Itis thought
that criminals of humble rank may have
been tried before the‘ praefectus urbis·
(see.6.11,3)‚and that inchargesof
incendiarism, the ‘praefectus vigilm’
had some sum power. The sma-
torial court is not likely to have bee-
employed in such a case.

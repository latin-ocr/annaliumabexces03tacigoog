perfectly subdued nations to the west, while the latter place and Lindum
were still the Roman outposts to the north, much was no doubt done to
re·establish order, and bring back commerce to its accustomed channels.
No subsequent outbreak within the conquered district is ever recorded 3 and
we may assume that the towns which had been wrecked soon rose from
their ruins, and that the fatal negligence which had left them unprotected
was not repeated. Camulodunum, in particular, may probably have
owed to this restoration the still remaining walls,¹ a mile and three
quarters in circuit, enclosing an oblong camp-like area of 108 acreS, a
space which, if forming the limit of the colonia at this date, is far short
of that covered by urban and suburban habitations in subsequent days

of peace.

The walls of Verulamium appear to be of similar strength to those at
Colchester, but are those of a town rather than of a military position,
enclosing an arm of nearly double the extent, and taking a circuit
bearing so considerable a resemblance to the size and shape of Pompeii ¹
as to have suggested the possibility of intentional imitation3 a sup-
position which, should it be confirmed by further investigation, would
tend to show that the town had been thus laid out before Pompeii was
destroyed, and therefore (as is otherwise probable enough) at a date soon

after its ruin in the insurrection.

The defence of Londinium appears to have been less completely pro-
vided for; as the only Roman walls now traceable round the city or
recorded by any evidence are referred to a much later date ⁸3 but the

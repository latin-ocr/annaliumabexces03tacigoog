cmm. 111] LIFE OF CLAUDIUS [21]

intensified his natural vices and eccentricities, and permanently formed
his character. Disgusting manners, gluttony‚ drink‚ lust, gambling,¹
became the propensities of such a life, redeemed to some extent by the
literary pursuits ¹ which alone kept him up to any higher level. Indica-
tions are not indeed altogether wanting that his nearness to the ruling
house still made him a person of some consideration. He was married
successively to two women of high family, Plautia Urgulanilla and Aelia
Paetina ⁸3 it was a valuable stepping-stone to Seianus to affiance a
daughter to his young son Drusus⁴; even Tiberius in his last moments
considered him among possible heim, were it not for the weakness of bis
mind,⁸ and left him a better position in his will than he had held in that
of Anguem·

On the accession os Gaius, he emerges from a position of obscurity
and neglect, and os personal safety assured thereby, into one of greater
outward dignity, combined with greater real degradation‚ and no slight
actual peril. From a mere knight he becomes senator and consul,“¹ to
be taken to task in his magistracy and all but deposed from it,⁸ and to
be treated with studied contempt in the senate-house ’ς he is promoted
to a priesthood, to find himself ruined by the expenses of assuming it¹05
he is sent by the senate as spokesman of its deputation to Gaius in Gaul,
to find the distinction go near to eost his lise, and (according to some
accounts) to be glad to escape with a ducking in the river ¹¹3 he is not
only the constant victim of the flouts and blows of Gaius himself,¹² but
also the butt sor all the rude horseplay and practical jests os courtiers and
buffoons at the imperial feasts.¹⁸

makes no allusion to it in its place.

sulate of Asia is probably to be dated
towards the end os the mle of Claudius,
and is attested by an inscription on
a statue base in the Heraeum at Sarnos,

1. 128 .

8. inquisitionem annnam, ‘a year
collecting evidence: for which
a considerable interval was generally
allowed (see c. 52, 2, and note on 3. 70,
1). Cicero, sor special reasons, used only
fifty days to collect evidence against
Verres (Verr. A. 1. 2, 6).

9. visum. The personswhosothought
must be his enemim in gener-al, as distinct
from those who had offered to impendi
him sor his proconsulate of Asia.

in Rome. Em. appears rightly to take
the ‘ sub' preceding this word in Med. as
a corruption arising ont of a repetition of
the last syllable os ‘visum ⁹.

10. Q. Pomponium. This person,
called by Tacitus ‘moribus inquies' (6.

fot

par- 18, 2), became coS. suff. on the death of

Gaius, and in that capacity exhorted the
senate to re-establish the Republic (Jos.
Ant. 19. 4, 5), or at least to set up a
worthy emperor (Id. B. 1. 2. ι ι, 2) 3 which
may probably have furnished ground of
accusation against him, and driven him
to join Camillus Scribonianus (see Introd.
p. 11). Nipp. notes that his name is
erased where it occurs as consul in the

keen delight in witnessing the butchery os the executioner and torturer.³
Many of these traits of utter insensibility must have been shown, not
only in the privacy of the palace, but before the eyes of Rome; and
if these are not to be set aside as fabrications, we have no reason
to doubt the statement, that at the death, however deserved, of one
who had been for some ten years his wife he ‘ showed no sign of hate,
joy, resentment, sorrow, nor in short of any human feeling,’ ⁴ and that
he ‘ had neither likes nor dislikes, except such as were instilled and

dictated.’ ⁶

Suet. (Cl3 29), who appears to follow
Seneca, gives the number of senators as
thirty -five, the knights at more than ‘three
hundred, but omits mention of the others.

complete record of Tacitus before us, such
a number as that given by Seneca or Suet,
could be made up: we have small means
of identifying the knights see11.4,1; 35,

speaks (13. 43, 3) of‘ equitum Roma-
norum agmina damnata’: as to the third
item, we are altogether in the dark, unless
the stories alluded to in Suet. 34 and the
vast number of ‘ sontes' in 12. 56, 5 may

illustrate it. It should also be obser-ved

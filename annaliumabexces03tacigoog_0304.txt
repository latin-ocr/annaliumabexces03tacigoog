CAP. 59, 60 137

Romani constituissent3 mox alias per provincias et in urbe
pleraque concessa sunt quae olim a praetoribus noscebantur:

4 Claudius omne ius tradidit, de quo toties seditione aut armis

certatum, curn Semproniis rogationibus equester ordo in posses-
sione iudiciorum locaretur, aut rursum Serviliae leges senatuis
iudicia redderent, Mariusque et Sulla olim de eo vel praecipue

in their abbreviated forms, to follow the
MS„ on the suppositioni that Tacitus
intentionally varied his ex ressions.

(Att. 3. 13, 1) and in Caesar (Β. C. 3.
1’5.)'slias per provincias, δια, i. e. to
Caesar’s tors both in the provinces
and in ome. With ‘concessa sunt‘,
‘procuratoribus’ would be supplied.

2. praetoribus. From the mention
of the provinces as well as Rome, Nipp.

rightly concludes that the term is used .

not only of praetors at Rome, but also oi
nthjeprovmcial governors (see 1. 74, 1, and

noscebantur - ‘cognonoebantur’z cp.
6. 9, 7, aud other uses οἱ sim le verbs
for compound (Introd. i. v. ς 40 .

3. tradidit, sc. ‘equestribus or‘pro-
curatoribus’. There is evidently, as
Mommsen has noted (Staatsr. ii. 981, a),
a confusion of thought in the whole of
this passage. The privilege at issue in
the contests os knights and senators under
the Re ublic was that of furnishing the

procurator, usually of equestrian rank,
without jurors, iu civil actious between
the princeps and individuals. On the old

⁴ controversy, Tacitus can hardly be said

to express a sympathy3 but we have the
evident animus of a senator as regards
the position of individual knights, and the
rise of that order, with the decay os the
senate, {ndu tbe c-pire (see Introd. i.

5. Serviliae, also pl. {or sing„ as only
the law of the consul Servilius Cae io

by other accounts (see Momms. Staatsr.

stored this privi ege to the knights (see
Long, on Cic. Verr. p. 51). Nipp. thinks
that both these laws are bere referred το,
and that some words like ‘ vel adimerent
have been lost after ‘ redderent '.

6. Uarius et Sulla. It is a great
exaggeration to describe this question as
one of the chief points at issue in this
struggle3 nor does there appear to be
any further foundation sor it than the fact
that Sulla, in his dictatorship, restored
the ⁶ iudicia’ to the senate( . 11. υ, 9).
Tacitus omits notice here o other laws,
especially the ‘lex Aurelia’ os 684, mc.
70 (Vell. 2. 32, 3; Cic. Verr. ii. 2. 2, 71,
174, διας Momms. l. l. 532), by which
‘urors were chosen from the senate, the

ights, and the ‘ tribuni aerarii ’, and of
the final constitution of the ‘iudicia’ by
Augustus (Introd. i. vii. p. 87).

then were those os classes, and the results
extorted were for the advantage of the
whole order’ (of senators or knights), as
contrasted with the subsequent ascendancy
os individuals. Most edd. retain the
Med. ‘ vicerant’, but Halm follows
Heinsius in reading evicerant. In either
reading ‘quae' is best taken as accusa·

On the latter see 11. 2 , 4, and note. He

Cicero in his letters often speaks os him
and Oppius, and gives a joint letter from
them to him (Att. 9. 7, A , as well as
others from Balbus se te y (Att. 8. 15
A; 9. 7 Β; ¹3 A). rom these sources
and others we gather that, besides their
importance as Caesar's financial agents
during his absence in Gaul, they were
also his confidants in his overtures to

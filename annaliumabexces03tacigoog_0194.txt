4 Nec multo post Curtius Rufus eundem honorem adipiscitur,
qui in agro Mattiaco recluserat specus quaerendis venis argenti 3
unde tenuis fructus nec in longum suit: at legionibus cum damno
labor, effodere rivos, quaeque in aperto gravia, humum infra
5 moliri. quis subactus miles, et quia pluris per provincias similia s,
tolerabantur, componit occultas litteras nomine exercituum, pre·
cantium imperatorem ut, quibus permissurus esset exercitus,

triumphalia ante tribueret.

Med. has ⁴ vetarentur’, which Lips. and
others have retained, taking the word to
be used rhetorically sor ⁴ arcerentur ’, and
ol ποταμοὶ ἐν τῃῖ τοῦ scrofa πλημυρίδα
ἅηρρὸοντσς τελαγίζωσιν, i. e. to provide
an additional channel to take off the
overflow oi water at the spring tides. But
it is nnlikely that so poetica] au expres-
sion would be used in such a place. and
modern edd. have generally followed
vertran. in reading ‘vitarentur ⁹. Some
(as Ritter, 1838), with this reading, still
take ‘incerta Oceani’ as above3 but if
Tacitus had meant to say what Dio says,
he would surely have been more ex licit:
and the expression here is identi with
that used of the perils of the sea in
generalia 3. 5 ‚ 6 (‘incerta maris et
tempestatum ’). e should therefore take
his meaning to be that the canal was
designed to enable ships to go from the
mouth of the Rhine to that os the Maas
without iacing the open sea, which must
have had au evil name from the disastcrs
os Germanicus (1. 703 a. 23-24). Dio
must in this ease have followed other
authorities, who assigned a different and,
ἰίἱὲῐίροαη, a less probable object for
mainis. This is a correction os Med.

ι. curtina Ruina, shown b the s-
sage to have been legatus of pper er-
mam&3233520220552231333:
found at Mainz in 1879, to have held that
province in A. n. 43 (see Pros- Imp. R. S.
p. 424, C. Ι. L. ¹3· 6797). That

’ he vm father or Q. curum Rarus. the,

historian, is very robable. uad he
been (as some have t ought) the historian
himself, Nipp. seems rightl to ¹suggest
that Tacitus would have sa so.

of a final clause (Introds i. v. ἦ aa b).

3. damno. Nipp. notes that the work
was probably unhealthy, that any injury
to their clothiug sen upon themselves (1.
17, 6), and that there was no booty to
compensate.

4. effodere rivos, generally taken to
mean digging streams to drain the mines.
Some (as Rup. and Walth.) retain the
Med. ‘ et fodere’, taking ⁸ et’ in the sense
oi ‘both ', and supposing this clause to
refer to the canal os Corbulo ς a reference
which is also possible, if ‘effodere’ be
read.

army wrote as on behalf of all. So Suet.
(Cl. 24) calls it ⁴ epistola communi legi-

8. triumphalia ante tribues-eu so
that generals who had no opportunities
of war, might not be tempted to earn the
honour by worlts os this kind. Suet. (1. l.),
who mentions the fact of this letter to
illustrate the prodigality with which
⁸ triumphalia ’ were awarded by this
prinoe, misses the irony os the request by
assigning as its object ‘ ne (legati) causam
belli quoquo modo quaererent’. Augustus

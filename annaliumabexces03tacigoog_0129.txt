and dread of Rome,¹ and solemnly in presence of his council investing
Tiridates with the diadem, dispatching a force to deal instantly with
Tigranes, and preparing to attack the frontier with all his strength?
Corbulo immediately met the challenge by dispatching two legions
to Armenia3 but the promptness was more apparent than real; for
the commanders are said to have been instructed not to be too ener-
getic,⁸ and the legions were not those which he had trained and
led, but the Fourth and Twelfth,‘ which had been left in Syria, and
could have been hardly more fit sor active service than his own had
been five years previously. On the other hand, all possible means
were taken to secure the frontier of Syria on the EuphrateS, and even
to threaten an advance from it ’ς and Tigranes, behind the strong
walls of Tigranocerta, well provisioned and gai-risoned, mocked the
seeble siege tactics of the ParthianS,⁸ whose horsemen were themselves
reduced to straits through the destruction of the herbage by locusts.⁷
Under these citcumstances we are certainly startled to find the Parthians
able, a short time later, to gain in return for their own retirement
from what is represented as a disadvantageous and untenable position,
no less an equivalent than the evacuation of Tigranocerta, the retreat
of the whole Roman army to such winter quarters as it could find
in Cappadocia, the permanent withdrawal of Tigranes, and the oppor-
tunity os sending to make terms at Rome on the basis formerly
proposed.⁸ In the imperfectiori of our record, no trustworthy ex-

fonnd for only two; inasmnch as this
part of the narrative cannot well be taken
to n before the spring of 814, Α. D. 61,
and t e disaster of Paetus must have taken
place before the end of 815, Α. 1). 62, as
the news of it reaches Rome in the fol·

⁸· The alleged secret instruction, ‘ com-2
effi ξξξξ· mmmm&
habere quam gerere malebat' (15. 3, ι),
cannot come from Corbulo's memoli-s and

seems taken from the accusation brought
against him afterwards; nor is the latter
sentence easily to be reconciled with his
apparent eagerness to settle matters (see
c· 9 ''1313th we are not expressly so told
in 15. 6, 5, it is reasonable to sup

that the legions now sent were those w 'ch
aftfrwards remained with Paetus (c. 6, 5).

transaction, the one, that which he repre·
sents as held by most rsons, and which
he himself adopts, an which must have
been that given by the admirers of Cor·

drew his forces from Armenia after a

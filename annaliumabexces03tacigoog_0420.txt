tion cp. c. 65, 23 1. 13, 2, and note; H.
2. ao, 3, &c.

1. Augustianorum. Nipp. thus cor·
rects the Med. ‘augusttanorum’ from
Suet. Ner. 25, and from the evidence of
several inseri tions. The term does not
appear to be ong exclusively to this date
(Schill. p. 134). Dio (61. 20, 4) calls
them Αὔγούστειοι, and speaks os them as
a σύστημα 32 πεντακισχιλίους στρατιώτας.
This complete organization a pears from
Suet. Ner. 20 to be of later ate, and to
have consisted only in small part of the
knights here mentioned. The people
followed their lead (16. 4, 4), and the
soldiers coeoeed those who were slack or
out os time (16. 5, 1).

2. am 111 spem potentiae (sc. ‘pro-
caces ³), ‘ with a view to the hope of influ-
enoe.' Halm, Nipp„ and Dr. so read,
with Acid.; Orelli reads ‘ spe ⁹, after
Murem others retain the Med. ‘in spe’
(with which Walth. would supply the
idea of ὄντες). ‘ In spem otentiae ’
occurs in H. 4. 42, 2, and simi ar expres-
sions are found 111 0. 63, 1; H. 3. 47, 2 ς
Agr. 24, 1: also ‘in spem . . . multitu-
dinis' (Liv. 1. 8, 4), ‘in quorum spem'
(Id. 21. 45, 4). &c.

3. personare, ‘ kept up a din'; so iu
16. 4, 4; also ‘non loquuntur solum,
verum)etiam personant ' (Cic. pro Cael.
ao, 47 , &c.

4. deum vocabulis appellantes,
him by names os gods? Dio
says ( 1. ao, 5) that they could be heard
crving out ὅ καλὸς Καῖσαρ, ὁ Ἀπόλλων, ὅ
Αὔγουστος, εἷς ὡς Πύθιος· μὰ σέ, Καῖσαρ, οὗ·
&is σε νικᾷ. Again‚ after his return from
Greeoe (Id. 63. ao, 5⁸· men would cry, uk·
pem τῷ Ἡρακλεῖ, Νέρωνι τῷ Ἀπόλλωνι,
and ἱερὰ φωνή. That men offered sacrifice
⁴ pro caelesti voce ’ is seen from 16. 22, 1.

5. agere-‘se gerere ’.

6. ludicrae: cp. 0. 14, 1.

7. adfectavit, ‘he made pretence to
a taste for poetry.' The context seems
in favour of taking the word in this sense,
and supposing Tacitus to mean that this
was merely assumed to diver-t attention
from his stage performanoes. Cp. ‘ imita-
tionem antiquitatis adfectant ’ (Quint. 1 1.
3, 10), ‘crebrum anhelitum adfectant ’
(Id. 11. 3, 56). ‘ adfectata aliis castitas,
tibi ingenita’ (Plin. Pan. ao). Ni p.
takes the word to denote a 110118 (10

see Teuffel, 281, 7-9. po

8. necdum insignis, &c.: so Halm,
who adopts ⁸ hi cenati ’ from Haase. The
corrupt Med. text, ‘necdum insignis
aetatis nati considere’ (with full stop
before ‘necdum ’), has ven rise to a
variety of emendations. ose of older
scholare are collected by Walther, the
more recent by Baiter and Halm: Ritt.
follows Med. in placing 8 full stop before
‘ necdum'. and reads ‘ e senatu ’ for · 11811 ’;
Madvig (Adv. Supp. p. 234) suggests 8
comma at ‘ insignis , followed by ‘ aetatis
venia (or possibly ⁸ vena ⁹, in the sense of
‘exuberance’) uti; ii considere ’. Νἱιίῗ.
reads ‘ necdum insignis claritas. i
considere ’ς Dr. has ‘necdum insignis ars
erat, hi cenati considere ’. None of these
emendations have found acceptancez but
the general sense seems to be made out,
that he chose those who had poetic skill,
but who had not made a name for them-
selves, and whose style would uot be
detected so as to prevent his taking the
credit os their joint compositione..

10. species ipsa . . . docet. TheJudge-
ment of Tacitus up to 110 founded on
a critical study of the extant poems.
Suet. (Ner. 5²) maintains them to be

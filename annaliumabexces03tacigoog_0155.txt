The necessity sor some central garrison in the established province to
make up sor this withdrawal of the legions to its outposts had been
soreseen 3 and it was apparently early in the government of Ostorius that
the island received its first Roman colony ¹3 sor the site of which, in
spite of the greater commercial importance of Londinium,¹ the choice
naturally sell on what had probably been from the time of its occupatiori
the seat of government, the old capital of Cunobelinus⁸3 which had
assumed under him an importance eclipsing that of all other British
‘ oppida ’, though still apparently resembling the general type ⁴ in con-
sisting of a large enclosed tract of some square miles, protected on the
east, north, and south by the tidal marshes of the Colne and its small
tributary (still called the Roman river), and on its assailable side, the
west, by strong earthworks, in part still traceable, from stream to
stream.⁸ On the formation of the colony, a theatre,⁶ and, no doubt,
other public buildings rapidly grew up, and a temple was, erected to
ClaudiuS‚⁷ to become, as other such had been, the provincial centre of the
cultus os Rome ⁸ ς but the whole place was laid out rather as a pleasure
resort than a military position,⁹ and no pains were taken to strengthen
its antiquated desences. Here, and at the large municipal town of
Verulamium, and most of all at Londinium, we are told of a great
population, Roman and Romanized,¹⁰ living in a fatal dream of security
destined to undergo a rude awakening.

Also the supposition t these two places

legions subsequeutl associated with them,
is rendered probab e by circumstances in
the narrative of the at insurrection (see

of the atling Street road appears to be
implied (p. [145]‚ n. ο). Many of these
roads are thought to have followed at least

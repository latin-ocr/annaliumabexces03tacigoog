Some three years more ² sufficed for the career of Poppaea, and to
close with it N ero’s domestic history. A't the birth of her child, she was
raised to the rank of Livia and Agrippina by receiving the title of
Augusta,² nor did she during her remaining short time outlive her
· influence3 and Nero, if, as was supposed, he had caused her death
by a passionate blow,⁸ was none the less sincere in deploring it. Men
knew well enough that her wantonness had been equalled by her beart·
less cruelty⁴; yet Thrasea alone ventured to protest by his absence ³
against the extravagance of her funeral honours⁶ and the deification that

Hardly less important than the horrors of his domestic life, in their
effect on Roman sentiment, were the various public displays of his
unbounded vanity. Their repression under his mother's influence has
been ,already noticed⁹3 and even after her death Seneca and Burrus
were able for a while to modify what they could not hinder. The first
attempt, in 813, mn. 59, ‘to satisfy one only of his longings, and

nominal success; the limitation to a few favoured spectators soon
passing on to the permitted, afterwards to the invited presence of all
the many who cared, and the many more who felt compelled to pretend
to care, to see the charioteering of an emperor.¹¹ His other leading
taste was in the same year partially gratified by the device of a festival,
· which, by its exceptional and quasi-family character,²⁸ might seem to
excuse not only the licentious revelry of its surroundings,¹⁸ but even his
own ‘ debut' as a scenic musician, and the strange incongruity of 3

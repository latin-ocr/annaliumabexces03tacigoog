(see Nipp! s note) that Tacitus is here
antedat' the accession osthis king, and
that it di not take place till the following
year· but Pros. Gardner has shown (see
note ou c. 14. 8) that the evidence derived
ficui coinage does not neoessitate any such
view. On the other hand, the later date
given by some ιο his accession is sully
consistent with the time at which he first
actually intervenes (c. 50, ι).

1 12. Verum inclinatio populi supererat ex memoria Germanici,
cuius illa reliqua suboles virilis; et matri Agrippinae miseratio
augebatur ob saevitiam Messalinae, quae semper infesta et tunc
commotior quo minus strueret crimina et accusatores novo et

sense akin to the use with dat. in the

3· A: regards the vexed question of the
orth ph os this word, it may be noted
thatfflq yform occurs in this MS. here
and in 16. 17, 5, and in the MSS. of Agr.
10, 3, the ‘u' form in the MSS. of six
other laces in Tacitus. The ‘ externa
miracu ' alluded to may probably be
such as the story representing Alexan-
der the Great as conceived of a god in
ae form of a serpent (Plut. Alex. 33
donator, onl here and in Vulg.
It is very probab e that Tacitus wrote

5? 0. Silium, already mentioned as
cos. design. (c. 5, 3). His father, a dis-
tinguished legatus os Upper Germany (1.
31, 2, &c.), had been forced to suicide in

maan. C

mn. 24 (4. 18, 1, solt). The Silii had
been a noble plebeian house, and were
now probabl raised to the patriciate (c.
25, 3), as uvenal (ιο, 331) calls this
Silius ‘ optimus hie et formosissimus idem
gentis patriciae '. From what is said
of his youth, he may have been below
the usual consular age3 bnt persons of
that rank are called ‘iuvenes' in 6.

6. Iuniam Sila-nam, mentioned sub-
sequently as the friend, and afterwards as

gith the sense of λανθάνειν (4. 45, α,

1)o. operire, ‘to hide ², or banish from
thought (cp. 3. 18, 3), is Nipperdey's
reading for Med. ‘operiri’: ‘opperiri’, the
alternative reading, in the sense of ‘to
wait sor’ (let it take its course) is not
quite satisfactory.

11. ovensibus adhaerescere, ‘ keeps
close to him when he goes out': cp.
‘duorum egressus coli ’ (3. 33, 4).

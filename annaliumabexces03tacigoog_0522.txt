Dr. and others would understand these
words of kindling fire upon an altar like
⁸ adolere ω’ or ‘altaria '); bnt the w ole
sentence seems certainly to oiut to such
an interpretation as that ο Νὶρρ., that
the altar itself was a kind of pyre os com-
bustible materials, and was set on fire.
whether its purpose was to light the

seems di ct from the regular altar sor
camp sacrifices (Marquardt, ii. 41 s, 4).

1. augurale, perhaps here a name for
the ‘ praetorium itself: see 2. 13, 1, and

note.

tion given (c. 26, 3 ς 13. 8, 4) of Corbulo’s
grandiloquence. The mention of ⁸ prisci
moris admiratio? may imply that he
dilated on the antiquity of these customs‚
perhaps to suggest a conti-ast between
the ancient greatness of Rome and the
ffmpfffftively modern emplre of the

rsacx ae.

2. adfecit. Ritt. inserts ‘ eum ’ atter
‘admiratione’. and Jacob notes that the

ronoun is usually in such cases expressed

y Tacitus (cp. ¹4· 10, 15 16. 14, 63 17,
4, &c.); but the omission is not harsher
than that in many other places (see
Introd. i. ν. 5 8).

spatium, sc. ‘temporis’, as in 1. 35,
7; Agr. 22, 1, &c-

3. statne, e. 31, 1. The statement of
Dio (62. 23, 4) that Monobazus and
Vologeses also came to Corbulo, is
certainly, as regards the latter, wholly
inconsistent with the account of Tacitus
here. Dio adds that they also gave

Ecbatanis. The opinion of Sir H.
Rawlinson, that two distinct cities under
this name are confused in ancient ac-
counts, will be found stated and discnssed
b Mr. VauxinD. of Geog. It will be
o served that the place here mentioned
is contrasted with ‘apud Medos’, and is
thus im lied to have been outside the
limits o Media Atro tene3 which would
agree with the site o Hamadau, in Media
Magna.

the joint embassy of c. 27, 1.

many other passages.

of c. 29, 3. Vologeses stipulates that his
brother shall receive from the governors
of all provinces through which he passa,
this mark os respect, which appears to
have been ri ‘dly limited to persons of
high rank. §.eptimius Severus is stated
(vit. 2, 6), when he was a legatus in
Africa, to have put to death one who
embraced him as an old friend, with the
words ‘legatum P. R. homo plebeius
temere amplecti noli ’. ·

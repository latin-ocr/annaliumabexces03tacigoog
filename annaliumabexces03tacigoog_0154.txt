cmv. v] CONQUEST oF BRJTAJN

[141]

Otherwise, the catastrophe appears to have made little difference,
except that no more pitched battles are risked, and that the tactics
previously successful are steadily adhered to. Almost immediately after
the sall of Caratacus, it is found necessary to fix the permanent head-
quarters of the Second legion at Isca Silurum¹ (Caerleon on Usk) 3 and
the position is with the greatest difficulty established. At one time the
force on the spot is barely rescued from utter destruction by the timely
support of the main army 3 ¹ at another, the foraging parties are cut off ’ς
at another, the whole legion sustains a reverse, and the Silures, rendered
only more desperate by threats of extermination,⁴ are again masters of
the country and draw other tribes to join them.⁶ From this time too
the hostility os the powersul Brigantes in the North bas to be reckoned
with ; and Venutius, one of their princes, comes to the front as the most
skilful national leader.⁸

Early in these renewed troubles Ostorius died at his post, worn out by
continual warfare ς’ and during the five years of Didius Gallus ⁸ and the

. one year os Veranius’ (805-811, mn. 52-58) no advance of dominion is

noted; though it is probable that in this period of seeming inaction the
chains of conquest were being firmly riveted upon the land within and
slightly beyond the space already subjected ¹⁰3 that Isca and probably its
subordinate post Venta (Caerwent) are strongly held against the Silures,
Viroconium against the Ordovices; while Deva (Chester) and Lindum
(Lincoln) form also outposts confronting the Brigantes; each of these
four positions becoming the headquarters of a legion, and all being
connected with each other and with their bases os support in the south-

east of the province by the long lines of the F oss Way and the Watling
Street, and their subsidiary brancheS.¹¹

qualified by the ‘paucis admodum castellis

year of Veranius is marked only by pre-
datory attacks on the Szlures, and extra-
vagant promises cut short by death (14.

above. The hostility of the Brigantes
supplies a natural motive for the occupa-
tion os Deva and Lindum: and the former
place would have been the natural base.

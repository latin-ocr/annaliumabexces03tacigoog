be presumed to have had also civil juris-

the regulations now made went evidently
to confer a definite jurisdiction not only
on these, but also on procurators of the
third rank, those charged with the super-
vision of the private estates of the princeps

dues in senatorial, or indeed in an ro·

had been hitherto very limited (see 4. 15,

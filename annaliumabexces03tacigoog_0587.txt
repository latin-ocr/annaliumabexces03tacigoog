3. It has been thought ¹ that suspicion may indeed have first tested
on the Jews, but that the leading members of that body at Rome may
have been enabled by the powerful assistance of Poppaea to shift the

charge entirely from themselves upon the Christiana, whom they demand ἕ

and were eagerly seeking opportunities to destroy.

In criticizing these views attention must be called to what Tacitus
distinctly states, and to such corroboration of his statements as can be
found elsewhere.

It is no doubt hardly relevant to say that Tacitus was himself well

aware of the distinction between Jews and christiam, and that his s

account of the origin and spread of Christianity is accurate as far as it
goes. But his explicit assertion that the ‘ Christians' were already, at
the time of which he is writing, so known and designated by the Roman
people,² is one which no careful historian would have made if he lud
not found thern so named in his authorities, who in this case were
thoroughly contemporary with the events, and describing circumstances
of the utmost public notoriety. There is no improbability in the suppo·
sition that the ‘influx of the Orontes into the Tiber⁸ ' might have already
carried to Rome a name already used, probably for some twenty years,
at Antioch ·⁴, already traceable as a term of reproach in the East,⁸ and
apparently familiar not many years after this ‘date at Pompeii.⁸ The
sect may well have been, as Tacitus seems to irnply, better known to
the common people than to the governrnent, though it may have forced
itself on the notice of the latter as early as 810, ΑΛ). 5·1;i and there ’Β
some reason to suppose that at the date of the siege of Jerusalem,
officers of the highest rank were aware that Christianity, though of

bantur ’) were Jewisb fanatica, who, if
not actually owning the charge of incen-
diarism (see note on ς 5), wem exultingat
the catastrophe.

¹ The possible Qency of Poppaea had
been noticed by Gibbon and others. In
recent times this view has been power-
fully stated by Renan (Origines du Chris·
tianisrne, iv. ch. vii.) and by Bp. Lightfoot
(Apost. F athera, t. ii. i. ro).

⁸ The first Epiust of St. Peter, addressed
to Christiana in the Asiatic revinces, has
the words εἰ δὲ ὦςΧρισ-ηαν (refluxu), μὴ

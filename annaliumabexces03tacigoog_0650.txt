 

SUMMARY OF EVENTS TILL NERO'S DEATH 483

of the defeat of Vindex brought him little comfort, as the attitude of
Verginius remained so ambiguous ; ¹ and all kinds os wild schemes of
vengeance or flight were reported as contemplated.²
A new danger now arose in what had been hitherto his great source os
strength, the praetorian guards. Both the praefects os that body appear
to have proved false to him 3 ⁸ but Tigellinus, enervated by vice and
disease, was cast into the shade by the bolder schemer Nymphidius
Sabinus‚⁴ who, when Nero had departed from the Palatium to the
Servilian gardens,⁶ persuaded the soldiers that he had already fled to
Egypt, and induced them to proclaim Galba emperor by offering in his
name an enormous donative os 30,ooo H. S, each.⁸
At midnight Nero found himself sorsaken by the cohort in attendance⁷
and deprived of the poison which he kept sor the last extremity,⁸ and fled
in disguise, with four attendants, to a villa of his freedman Phaon, distant
about sour miles from Rome, between the Salarian and the Nomentan
way.⁰ The decision of the praetorians emboldened the senate to pro-
claim Galba emperor, to declare Nero a public enemy, and to sentence
him to be put to death ‘ more maiorum ’.ι’ In his hiding-place he was
informed that the soldiers were upon his track, aud aster vain attempts to
dispatch himself, received his deathstroke partly at his own hand, partly
at that of his freedman Epaphroditus.¹¹ He died on June 9,¹² aged
thirty years», five months, and twenty-six days, having ruled thirteen years,
seven monthS, and twenty-eight days3 and received honourable burial at

² The statement that Nero heard περὶ
τοῦ Ῥούφου ὅτι αὐτοῦ ἀπέστη (Dio, 63. 27,
1) is inaccurate3 but Verginius was
evidently ready to recognize any new

of Nymphidius, that of Plutarch, makes
him not actually depose his colleague
Tigellinus till after the death os Nero

also now promised to all the legionaries,

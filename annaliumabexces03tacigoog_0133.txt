the only chance was that of a coup de math, which >in any ordinary case
must have proved a failure‚ and which only a series of unforeseen
:blunders crowned ‘with complete success. ,
. The Twelfth legion was brought up to the Roman head quarters3 and
-the whole army, with its weakness revealed by concentration,¹ was
advanced on a reconnaisance in force² beyond the Taurus pass ’ς whence
‘on the first collision both sides seem to have receded, the Romans
retreating hastily to their camp, the Parthian advance probably falling
back on their main body,⁴ a movement so misinterpreted by Paetus as to
lead him to think that an isolated force of 3000 legionaries on the height,
supported by a body of cavalry on the plain, would suffice to arrest his
enemy’s progress. By their speedy annihilation or dispersion, Paetus
was left deprived of his best horsemen ⁶ and of probably near half his
legionaries,⁸ to hold out with the temnant (now still further weakened
by the detachment of a cohort to Arsamosata ⁷) till the succour, at last
urgently implored,⁸‚ should arrive with Corbu10. That the case was still
not desperate is evidenced by the fact that provisions still remained, and
that the Parthians, though time was all-important, made no attempt to
storm the camp ⁹: nor, to do Paetus justice, is he represented by Tacitus
as himself inclined to flinch from his undertaking,¹⁰ but as forced to
make terms by the utter demoralization of his troops ²¹3 which, partly no
doubt, due to their original unfitness for service, had been aggravated
by constantly increasing proof of their leader's incapacity, and finally
brought to a head when the wounded survivors of the carnage on the
mountain· returned to increase the consternation and dismay.²¹

The terms of capitulation, however less ignominious than rumour
afterwards made them to have been,¹⁸ were ignominious enough. The

enar. 111] RULE OF NERO [61]

It was again within this period, in the fourth year of his rule,¹ that a
new and overpowering influence took hold os him, that os the beautiful
and abandoned woman who, adding judicious coyness ² to consummate
profligacy, and combining in herself the characters os the intr-iguer,⁸ the
wit,⁴ the devotee,⁸ and the fatalist,‘ was enabled during the seven
remaining years os her lise to keep a firm hold on his affections,² and
to lead him on from crime to crime.

The remainder of this sketch will deal rather with distinct subjects
than successive periods, and show the way in which various parts of his
character unsolded themselves, One such subject is almost completed in
the Fourteenth Book, which begins with one and ends with another of
the two great atrocities os his domestic life.

With regard to the first os these, the graphic narrative of Tacitus is
confirmed in its main points by other writerS, though for much of the
detail and nearly all the antecedent cimumstances he is our sole
authority.

ascendancy had been decided against her, and the show no less than the
substance of regency had vanished,⁸ Agrippina was no longer a force
to be reckoned with. At what seemed then the crisis of her fate, a single
interview with her son had so worked upon him as to change the whole
sace of the situation’3 and even as the breach went on widening, the
habit of submission to that terrible will had become such second nature,
that Nero never dared to indulge his longing to exhibit himself on the
stage.¹⁰ Poppaea again could feel that never, while Agrippina lived,
could she hope to become N ero's wife,¹¹ and that he could easier be led
to compass her death than to defy her openly. So she plies him with all
the weapons of sarcasm, reproach, lamentation, tenderness, ¹⁸ herself well

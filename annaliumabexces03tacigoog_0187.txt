puts Cecrops in place of Cadmus appears
to be found only here3 that respecting

of writing is ascribed in general terius to
Palamedes by Stesichorus (see Fr. 31 [38

to rometheus gy Aeschylus (Prom. V.

ber os sixteen letters embodies the truth
that the Greeks modified the original
Phoenician alphabet by dropping the
symbols to which they had no correspond-
ing mund, and adapting other symbols to
their vowel sounds3 but as s sub-
sequent additions, the only trustworthy
evidence is that aflorded by the oldest

rson is represented as the father of
ll‘earquinins Priscus (Livy, 1. 34, s), the
tradition would represent the introduc-
tion of the art of writing to have been
os much later date ln Etruria thau in
Latium; this would be the reverse of
the general belief ς
Mommsen (Hist. B. 1. ch. 14) inclines
to question, and considers the alphabet
to have existed from a very early time
among both peoples.

the Latius in Liv. 1. 1. 5, and in other
authors. Evander of Arcadia, the mythi-
cal sounder os the original Pallanteum on
the Palatine hill (Verg. Aen. 8, 51, foll.)‚
is credited with the introduction os writ-
ing also by Dion. Hal. 1. 31. Pliny (Ι. c.)
makes the Pelasgi the introducers. That
the art was brought into Italy by Greeks
is undoubtedly true3 and Evander is to

6. forma. Med. has ‘ formas’3 many
follow Beroald. in reading ‘ formae ’. The
identity of old Greek characters with the
Latin of his day is noted by Pliny (N. Η.

tion on a tri
existing in t e Palatine library.

an overstatemenn as the known additions
are not numerous. Cicero speaks (N.

as one os twenty-one letters, of which
‘ G: though found in the earliest of the

who may probably, at the time os the
first Punic war, have taught its general
use. Also ‘ X ³, though found in the
earliest extant writing, is traditionally‚
and from its position in the alphabet‚
an addition, or reintroduction, and was
not in universal use (cp. ‘ucsori ’ in 1. R.
N. 5173. &c.). In Cicero’s time ‘ Y ' (see
Orat. 48, 160) and ‘ Z' (which appears to
be an old letter which had become obso-
lete), came into use, but were restricted to
Greek words, so that ‘ X' is still (see
Suet. Aug. 88) looked upon as properly
the last letter. See Mommsen, Hist. l, 13

itself being already in use in its proper

‘V’, the ‘antisigma’ (⁸ 3’) to express
‘ps' or ‘bs', and‘ F' (the Greek sign of
the ‘spiritus asper’) to express the ‘ y ²
sound intermediate between ‘ i ’ and ‘ u ’

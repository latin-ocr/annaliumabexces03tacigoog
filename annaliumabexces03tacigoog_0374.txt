valido praesidio ob magnitudinem moenium, nec id nobis virium
erat quod firmando praesidio et capessendo bello divideretur,

oblatum: nam cuncta Artaxatis tenus sole inlustria fuere3 quod

1. lovis. Med. has ‘lt-nv, whence
{ome follow Heius. in reading ‘ praemissa
evi '.

4. Artaxatis ienis immissus. On
the reasons which make it probable that
Corbulo wintered in the town and did not
destroy it· till the following spring see

Introd. p. 114, 2.

⁵· nee teneri teram. Nipp. (ed. 4)
and Dr. follow alm in inserting ⁸
terant ', which Ritt. prefers to insert ore
⁶ praesidio'. In neither place is its loss
easily explained, but it is even less satis·
factory to read ‘ teneres’ as a potential
subjunctive as in c. 3, 6, &c.), as Nipp.
formerly , or to take the Med. text
(with Ern. and Doed.) as a harsh anaco-
luthon; ‘ poterant ’ being supposed to be
supplied 111 sense from ‘nec id nobis
virium erat'.

7. quod . . . divideretur, ⁸ such as
could be divided between leaving a strong
guard (cp. ‘ firmatis praesidiis ’ Ἣ. 14,
4) and carrying on the war! The tives
are those of purpose.

8. vel si. &c- Aster ‘nec' . . . ‘nec’‚
a third alternative would naturally be
introduced by ‘sin vero'. The use of
‘vel’ insucha case isakintoits useby
Tacitus for ‘aut’, as in 14. 35, 4, διο.

9. miraculum: The ecli of A ’l
3ο, ΑΛ). 59, is mention by P iny
as having been seen in Armenia by Cor·
bulo (see note on 14· 12, 3); and Egli
(p. 284) takes this to be the phenomenon
here spoken os, and grounds much of his
chronology on the identificatiou. But
the climate would not allow a campaign
to have begun so early (see Momms. Hist.
v. 386, 1 3 E. T. ii. 53, 1) ς and the eclipse

ob haec consalutatus imperator Nero, et senatus

must therefore have been observed when
the army was in some winter quarters.
Nor is it possible that Tacitus, or Corbulo
(whom no doubt he here closely follows),
could ever have been understood to mean
an eclipse by any such description as is
here given. ‘ Miracnlum ' is probably
one of the ⁴ verba magnifica’ (c. 8, 4) of
Corbulo himself ; who must apparently
have seen some unusually striking effect
of cloud and sunshine accompmying a
thunderstormz which, from its coincidence
at such a moment, presented itself to his
imagination as a sign of divine wrath
impending over the devoted city.

10. cunctam-‚xnus tenus. So Halm,
aster Acidalius, for Med. ‘ cuncta extra-
tectis actenus’ (with ‘h ’ writtm above
‘ a ’ by a late hand). The old edd. fol·
lowed inferior MSS. in altering ‘ tectis’
to ‘tecta'; many, aster Lips. altered ‘hac-
tenus’ to ‘tenus’3 Nipp. brackets ‘extra
tectis ' as the corruption of a gloss, which

mwzsszzzssstffiztzffisszz
reason, bracket ‘ tectis hactenus'3 Weis-
senborn would read ‘ tectis ac portis
tenus .

11. ita repente. In Med. ‘repente’ is
placed before ‘ moenibus ⁹. Most editors
agree to place it, as in text above, after
ί ta 9

12. dicentum, ‘parted off from the
rest’: cp. ‘velo discreta· (c. 5, a). This
interpretation appears to suit the context
better than that of ‘ seamed' (cp. ⁴ telas
discreverat auro’ Verg. Aen. 4, 264).

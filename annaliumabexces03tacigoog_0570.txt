1. libare so, sce. Thrasea uses the

‘liquorem ’ denotes blood mingled with
the water. Lips. notes that the de arture
from lise is here likened to the c ose of
a feast, at which it was the Greek custom
to offer a parting libation to Ζεὺς Σωτήρ
(Suid. s. v.), for whom ‘ Iuppiter Libe-
rator ' is here ap ropriately substituted.
This attribute o the god is found in
Latin only in these passages, ou coins of
Nero (Eckh. vi. 272; Cohen, i. p. 288.
110. 124), and in an old Calendar (see
C. LL. 1. p. 274 ‘ludi Iovi liberatori' (in
October», but is no doubt taken from the
well-known Ζεὺς Ἐλευθέριος (Pind. Ol. 1 2,
1; Thue. 2. Ξ1, 4, &c.). The reference
made by Pro Holbrooke to the custom
of ponring libation from the poisoned
Ysss⁰w²35ss¹¹<¹÷2⁸ssffisff²fsffi.‘3>fftff
Phaed. 117 C), seems here less apposite.

2. balneo. the hot vapour·bath of the
maeoniam& The same mode of suffo-
cation was used for Octavia (14. 64, 3),
Vestinus (c. 69, 3), and others (16. 11, 4).

3. codicillis, ⁴ written instructions!
The term is used of testamentary writing
in 16. 17,6: 19, 5: cp. 14. 50, 1.

oum susm tum, διο. The expres-
sion implies that his vast walth, no less
than his commandin influenoe, had al-
ready passed away his death. This

ves some support to the statement of
{io (62. 25, 3), that he had resigned all
his property to Nero, nominally as a con-
tributiou to the eost of restoring Rome
aiter the fire. He had however still
some villas (c. 60, , 8), and intended to
make bequests by wisi (c. 62, 1); and Juvenal
:galus of his s lendid gardens as though

y were still is at his death (10, 16).
5. Subrium mavum ε see c. 49. 2, &c-
8. qussi insontibus, etc. The Med.

text is retained by most edd., and requires
no alteration3 ‘insontibus ' “ well
taken as dat. of the agent (Intr i. v.
5 18). By killiug Piso, they would seem
to have had no share in the conspiracy
of which he was head, and only to have
sought afterwards to replace Nero by the
best possible successor. Nipp. would
take ⁸ insontibus’ tomeun those of the
leading men who were of pure character,
as contrasted with the dissolute nobles
(c. 49, 53 67, 1 3 70, 2), who would only
have replaoed a Nero by a Piso (c. 48,
4) 3 but the meaning given above (-‘ in-
sontibus coniurationis ) is more in accord·
ance with the sense of the word in other
gunges (ο. 52, 5³ 73, 23 16-10, 5‚&0·)·

he various corrections pro , as ‘ in-
sonti et’ (Acie), ‘ exinsontibus’ §Rittffl
⁴ sontibus’ (Wurm)‚ ‘ in sontibus (jan-
sen), appear to be needless.

in Plaut. Truc. 2. 4, 4ο (‘cui rei id te
adsimulare retulit '), and with that os the
person in Hor. Sat. 1. 1, 49 (‘quid re·
ferat intra Naturae finis viventi ’); and
such a construction might here be illus-
trated by the extension os the ‘ dativus
commodi ' in Tacitus (Introd. i. ν. 5 17),
and by his other uses of that ease (Id.
55 ²03 21 c). On the other hand the

play in public.

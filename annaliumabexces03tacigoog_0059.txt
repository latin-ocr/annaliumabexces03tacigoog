done him more than justice as an orator, both by exemplification and
estimate‚¹ have called him imbecile on the strength of such failings
as he hardly cares to notice, such as his pedantry and vanity,² or even
the absurd inequality and absence of all dignity and proportion in his
edicts and other public utteranees? The justification of such a term
is rather to be found in his unconsciousness of patent facts going on
around him, his apathy, weakness of will and purpose, readiness to be
swayed by those who had the last word with him, qualities by no means
testing on the sole evidence of satire.

That his nature was to some extent always such, Tacitus undoubtedly,
and perhaps erroneously, believed; ⁴ but on the other hand, much of
the contrast between the good an‘d evil reports of bimis explained by
differenoe of time, and by circumstances which probably did not escape
an acute historiari. It is in the outset of his rule that nearly all his
wisest acts are reckoned,‘ when his own energies were at their best, and
when all about him, from senators to sreedmen, must have seen that
their interest lay in producing a good impression to contrast strongly
with the preceding tyranny. It is after six years of wearying routine and
unrestrained sensual indulgence that we find him in the premature
senility and decay which Tacitus represents, and which he may have
traced, as in the case of Tiberius, step by step3 leading to a stage in
which the speech on the Galli'c question is almost a solitary flash of
energy, and such senseless extravagances as the preparation of a great
fleet for a sham fight on lake Fucinus are hardly to be distinguished from
the wild excesses of Gaius3⁶ while the general state of relaxed tension,
in which Rome is again brought as near to famine as it had been under
the misgovernment preceding his rule,‘¹ important imperial interests are

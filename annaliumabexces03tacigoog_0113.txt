The opportunity which Augustus was thus calmly biding seemed to

sor the surrender of Tiridates, and of an infant son of his own carried
off by him, was met by sending back the latter, with a stipulation, which
was disregarded or frustrated by delay, sor the surrender in return of the
captives and standardS.¹⁰ It can hardly have been without the co-opera·

Syria three years later, unsupported, as sar as we know, by any more
than the ordinary military force of the province, sufficed to win without
a blow all the demands which had been for so many years resisted, as

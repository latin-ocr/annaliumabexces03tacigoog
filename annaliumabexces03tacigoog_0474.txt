1. gravioribus iam ludibriis quam
malis, ‘the mockery (of this condem-
nation of dead men) seeming even more
revolting than the crimes ’ (the murder
itsels): the former caused more indig-
nation against the senate than even the
latter against Nero. Another such act
is similarly commented on in 16. 11, 6
(‘ea caedibus peractis ludibria adicie-
bantur ’); but such sentences were not
alt ether without their significance as
a ‘ mnatio memoriae ’. ‘ Iam ⁹ is read
by Freinsh. and Nipp., aster MS. Agr„

correction of the Med. ‘ti’ (⁸ tam ’),
which may also be taken as an error
for ⁸ ταῶ ’ (‘ tamena), the reading of most

capable of a similar meaning to that

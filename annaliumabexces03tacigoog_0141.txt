Augustus must have roused expectation to its height in 727, ac. 27.¹ This
intention again is stated to have been frustrated in the following year by
the rising of the Salassi and the obstinate resistanoe of the Cantabrians ’ς
and some doubt may be allowed whether a conquest of Britain, any more
than of Parthia,⁸ was ever seriously entertained, in the light ofhis reduction
of the vast army that had come under his command at the close of the civil
war to a standing peace establishment of only eighteen legions.⁸ It is at
any rate certain that from the year above mentioned the idea of a British
expedition fades out of si ght,⁸ and that, at some time afterwards, some similar
combination of policy and good fortune to that which brought about a peace-
· ful solution of the Parthian question ⁸ enabled Augustus to save his credit,
and to present his object as substantially gained, without loss of blood or
treasure. Two British princes are recorded by the ⁸ Monumentum
Ancyranum ⁹ to have fied from their land to his protection ⁷3 and we may
therefore suppose that the event was duly represented at the time in some
light favourable to Roman dignity ⁸; while some more unmistakable acts
of homage are instanced by Strab0,⁰ who describes the island generally
as rendered friendly, and adds what we may suppose to be the official
reasons against its occupatiori as a province. ¹⁶

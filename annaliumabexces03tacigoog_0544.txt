ter-ms, and says (62. 18, 5) that he even
withdrew the corn allowanee (τῶν Ῥω·

which, in the light of what Tacitus states
in c. 39, 2, is most improbable.

provinciae. Nipp. thinks that by
this term here the ⁸ stipendiarii ' alone are
meant, by ⁴ socii populi ’ the ‘ civitates
foederatae ⁹, and by ⁴ quae civitatium
liberae vocantnr‘ the ‘civitates liberae’‚
and those called ‘liberae et immunes' ;
and that the privileges of both these
classes were now, as on many other oc·

vassa] princes, or to su pose (see M omma.
Staatsr. iii. 725, 4) that ‘socii populi ’
and ‘ liberae civitates ’ are here a specific
description of ‘ provinciae ’, and refer
respectively to the unprivileged and pri-
vsseged peoples. This explanation would
be supported by ‘ foedera sociis dilargiri ’
(Η. 3· 55, 2); though Tacitus elsewhere
use? ‘socii’ more generally, asin ‘foederi
melae urbis' (2. 53, 3).

‘ formed part of that plunder.' Dr. notes
that the use of these expressions with a
personal subject (cp. 6. 43, 1 ς also ⁴ N ori·

horieal only; the treasures in the temples
being really spoken of.
6. auro: such offerings of gold are

triumphis . . ·. votis, ‘ on occasions
of triumphs or vowsss The construction
seems analogous to the simple abl. of
time and place: cp. ‘ proconsulatu' (H.

but the sense of ‘ per prospera’ or ⁸ rebus
prosperis’ is clearly required by the anti·
thesis ‘ in metu ’, which may here denote
a state of circumstances», rather than a
frame of mind, as in 1. 40, 1 (where see
note), 8το- Adverbs and nouns are some-
times co-ordinated, as in 2. 11, 33 16.

(ro. 7, 1) that Nero took 500 statues
from Delphi alone, and elsewhere (6. 25,

of statues, the finest of which had been
pillaged by Nero for the Golden House,
and were afterwards given by Vespasian
to various temples built by him (see N.
H. 34. 8, 19, 84). Pergamum appears to
have offered active resistance to the ex-
tortion (16. 23, 1) ς and Dio Chrys. men·
tions (Or. 31. p. 644 R) that Rhodes was
for some reason specially exempted by
Nero, and gave up nothing of its great
abundanee. Such pillage on a smaller
scale was common at all times t see Juv.

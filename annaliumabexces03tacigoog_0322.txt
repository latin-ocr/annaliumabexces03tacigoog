1. praeceptis eloquentiae et eoml-
tate honesta, ‘by his lessons in eloquenee
and his dignified courtesy‘ (C. and B.).

iuvantes invicem, ‘ helpin each
other.' The omission of ‘ se’ this
expression (cp. 14. 17, ²3 H. 1. 74, 2; 2.

natural usage with ‘ inter se’, one which
is also found in Tacitus (2. 30, 1 ς 3. 1, 3,
&c-): see Nipp. on 1 ,17, 2.

·2. lubricam, ‘ perilous’: cp. 6. 49, 3,
and note. ι

5. ln partibus, ‘on her side'; so

7. aed. The thought is that Pallas
had, for two reasons, little power over
Nero; and it is implied by the following
‘ tamen ' that Agri pina’s influence also
was being weakenecE

inm servos, ‘ submissive to a slave ’ z

(11. 21, 4); ‘tristes (16. 22, 3); ⁶ tristi-
uam'(Ag1-. 9. 4). On the arrogance of
Pallas cp. 12. 53, 2, Ere.

9. in eam . . . cumulabantur. For
this expression c . 1. 21, 4, and note.
Tacitus has also e more usual ‘cumu-
lare aliquem aliqua re’‚ as in 12. 53, 5,
fite. On the honours given her see Introd.

signum, ⁶ the parole' (supplied a ain
with ‘Optimae matrls’R: cp. ‘af o
Felicitatis dato ⁹ (Bell. A r. 83, 1). ‘he
word was given by Nero, as also by Ti·
berius (1. 7, 7), to the officer command-
ing the eohort on guard at the palace-

1o. duo lictores, sc. ‘ei ' (‘ Agrip·
pinae '). Tiberius had refused this honour
to Livia (1. 14, 3).

1 1. flamonium Claudiale. On the
form ‘ flamonium ' see 4. 16, 3, and note.
Livia had held the similar office of “ flami-
nica Augusti g
46, 1). We nd.also that there was a
⁴ flamen Claudialis ⁹ (C. Ι. L. 9. 1 12 3), and
that the college of ⁸ sodales Augustales'
were charged with his cultus (see 1. 54, 1,
and note. also C. I. 1.. 11. 1595, δια).
This decree is mentioned here with the
other honours to Agrippina, bnt must
have been subsequent in date to the deifi-
cafion of Claudius.

simul Claudio, &e On the men·
tion already made of this see 12. 69, 4,

decreed some days after his death (1. 8,
1), and his apotheosis not till after the
funeral (1. 1ο, 8) 3 such an interval being
here marked by the distinction between
‘simul’ (‘ at the same sitting ') and‘mnx',
as the subject of the funeral goes on to
the next chapter. The apotheosis of
Claudius was so far formally complete
that the appointments above noted were
made, his cultus recognized in the ‘Acta
Arvalium ’‚ and that Nero is styled ‘ Divi
Claudi f: on inscriptions and coins; still
the satire of Seneca, and the jests of his
brother Gallio and of Nero (Dio, 60. 35,
3), seem to show that it was hardly ‘taken-

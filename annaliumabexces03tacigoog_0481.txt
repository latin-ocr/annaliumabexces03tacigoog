in 15. 74, 1.

3. patientia posu-omum, ‘the utter-
most in submissivcnesa' The sentiment
may be compared with Agr. 2‚3 ‘dedimus
profecto grande patientiae documentum,
et, sicut vetus aetas vidit quid ultimum in
libertate esset, ita nos quid in servitute‘.
‘Postremus’ is so used by Cic-2
‘ hominupostremi ' (Rosc. Am.47‚ ¹37 ,
‘ servitus postremum mal
(Phil. ο. 44, 113).

4. libertorum, dte. Suet. (Ner. 35), as

in so many instanoes (see Introd. i. viii. p.
134), speaks vagnely and generally, with-
out giving names: ‘libertos divites et

noticed that what Tacitus is eareful to

(l. L), with circumstantial details, as an
established fact.

Nero of ten million HS„ that he held the

any pretext have been assigned in auch a

6. Pallantem. See η. 29, 1, διο.
Dio 562. 14, 3) appears to assert as an
estab ished fact that he was put to death
in some way (τὸν Πάλλαντα διεχρήσατο).

According to Gaius (3. ς 43), when a
freedman left less than three children
and died possessed of more thau
too‚oo'o HS„ the patron could claim,
under the Lex Papia Poppaea, a ‘portio
virilis', or share eqnal to that of one child.

7. Romanus. It appears proinble
that this person. thus mentioned with the
others without further explanation, vas
one of the same rank with them. Nipp-
would identisy him with a “I'i. Claudius
Romanus ’, whose name would show that

’ he was a freedman of Claudius, and who

is mentioned in a ‘ collegium ⁹ of freed·
men and slaves at Antium in mn. 48
(Fast. Antiat. in C. 1. L. i. p. 3²7)- Ritt.
(Philol. xx. 291) supposes a lacuna to
exist in which the praenomen (⁸ T: or
‘Ti.’) was given, and some par·
ticulars of what became o him. It is
also possible that his name may have been
here thus briefly given, as one already
familiar to readers from mention in the
lost portion of the work. Hispo Romanus
(1. 74, 1) can hardly have been still
alive ς Fabius Romanus would not a pear
from 16. 17, 4 to have boen m ed

8. socium. This term would seem to
imply some treasonable design already

time later. ue must therefore suppose
that the accuser only alleged that
Seneca sought Piso’s society, and that
the distinguished position of the latter
made this seem suspicions. This is
certainly not in aecordanee with the
usual meaning of ‘ socius’3 and Nippls
bold substitution of ‘ amicum ’ might
be defended by supposing the former

1. foedera et civitatem. [These chiet's
belonged to elans, such as those of the
Aedui, Remi, and Lingones, which had
a ‘foedus ⁹ with Rome, and were also
themselves Roman citizens. Roman
citizenship had been freely bestowed by
Julius and Augustus on Gauls οἱ rank
(e. g. Sacrovir and Florus).—P.] .

ius adipiscendorum, dte. [It is a
mistake to suppose that these Gaulish
chiess or their fathers had received a
defective or ‘ l citizenship. The
disability, sor e removal os which they

‘tioned, was not peculiar to them. N o

tracy (in urbe honores) unless he was
,a senator, or entitled to wear the ‘ broad
stripe' (latus clavus) and thus possessed
of ⁶ dignitas senatoria '. and a member of
the senatorial order. These Gaulish ehiess
were clearly not senators, nor entitled
either by birth, as senators’ sons, or by
im rial grant to the broad stripe. See
Pephffm, Classical Review, 1895, p. 441.

studiis . . . certabatur. [There was
a ‚conflict os opinion among the coun-

restated his own view of the case. Tacitus
seems to have combined the two utter-

ful chiess, whose fathers had fought
against Rome (infra sect. 6). Claudius
replies to objection 1 in chap. 24, sect.
1-7, and to objection 2 in sections 8-10.
ln the original speech the arrangement is
clearer. After replying to objection 1,
Claudius posses (Or. Cl. ii. 9) to thecase of
Narbonese Gaul, then (ii. 19-28) to that
of the colony of Lugdunum, and finally
(ii. 29) to the case ot' the petitioners ‘ de·

5. oomanoeuineis populis, probably
best taken, with Niplp„ as dative: ‘the
rule of native-born omaus (i. e. os a
senate exclusively of those belongin to
the “ager Romanus'') had once su ced
sor (had been acquiesced in by) kindred
peoples’ (who had a sainer claim than
strangers to a share os power). Others
take ‘ suffecisse· to mean ‘had supplied a
senate to kindred peoples '; others make
‘consanguineis po ulis’ abl. abs. (see
Ruperti's note). e time referred to

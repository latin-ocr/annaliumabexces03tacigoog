accepted as the rightful heir, and maintained himself sor some few years

NeverthelesS, the Parthian kings generally made no scruple os inter·
posing from time to time in Armenia 3² in which, from the appointment
of Tigranes 11 in 734, 13.c. 20, we have for nearly forty years an almost
continuone history of interference and intrigue, resulting in revolution
and anarchy. The account of these vicissitudes can be read as related in
its place by Tacitus ⁸ ; but it will be well to compare here the alternatives
open to Rome in dealing with this Asghanistan of the ancient world.

Subsequent experience may be taken generally to have shown that
a policy of complete non-interference would have been best, and that the
efforts os Rome were sar more needed in extending and consolidating
the empire in other quarters3 but Augustus could not slight the traditions
os the Republic, or allow it to be said that even an imaginary limit of the
empire had receded under him. Also, from the time of the domicile
of the heirs of Phraates in Rome, the idea os bringing the Parthian
empire itself under Roman influence through a monarch of the stamp os
Vonones must have been constantly present 3 and for any military
demonstration to support a friendly or threaten a hostile king, the most
practicable route was that which rested on Armenia as a base, and led
along the Tigris to Ctesiphon.⁴ On the other hand, the transitory success
achieved under TraJan cannot well be regarded even as subsequent evi-
dence in favour os the possibility of holding Armenia as a province,⁸
a course which must certainly have been beyond the pale of practical
politics when the provincial frontier in Asia Minor had not extended beyond
the Halys-⁸ A second alternative, that of controlling it as a vassal king-
dom, is the one which we have to consider as maintained throughout this
period, in various forms from substantial dependence to mere nominal
acknowledgement of suzerainty, and always under the great difficulty of
contending with national affinities and sympathy, balanced no doubt by
some dread of Parthian despotism.⁷ [There was indeed a third alternative,

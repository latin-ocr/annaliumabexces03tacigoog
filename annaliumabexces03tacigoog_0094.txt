certainly at that date that we find the first open mark of Nero’s dis·
pleesure,¹ which, though followed immediately by an outward show os
reconciliation, must have lest a sting behind in both minds.⁸ After this,
again sor three years we hear no more3 and then, without any additional
circumstances to explain it, the attack is launched upon him, beginning
with an invective by his old enemy Capito Cossutianus,⁸ followed by a
second prohibition from the emperor-'s presence, and a dignified demand
on his part to know the charge against him, which is answered by an
instant summons of the senate to dispatch the trial.⁴

No charge whatever of the most remote or indirect complicity in the
Pisonian or any other conspiracy is ever alleged or hinted2⁶ dereliction
of public dnties‚ an offence never before made the subject of a capital
charge or criminal prosecution of any kind,⁸ is all that the accusers have
to go upon‚⁷ or that the emperor even glances at in his rescript to the
senate ς ⁸ the rest is mere inflation of rhetoric. The orators are careful
to point out how important, and how closely touching the emperor per·
soually, were some of the occasions on which he had been absent, such
as the solemn vows and ratification of ‘ acta’ at the beginning of each

funeral,¹⁹ the trials of Silanus and Anteius 3 ¹¹ nor do they fail to note that
not senatorial duties alone had been thus contemptuously avoided; that
in the college of the ‘ quindecimviri ', at the offerings for the preservation
of the prince and for his ‘ divine voice ’,ι’ Thrasea’s absence had been no
less conspicuous3 even an old story of want of heartiness at the ‘ Juve-
nalia' is thrown in 3¹⁸ and on this slender foundation the elaborate fabric
os a charge of treason and impiety is built up,¹⁴ Still more remarkable
is the way in which his son-in-law Helvidius Priscus, and his friends
Puconius Agrippinus and Curtius Montanus are thrown in with him, ap·
parently at the last moment, and on charges yet more flimsy.¹⁸ The first

origin of Christianity or of the life of Christ to supplement the hare
’ record here vouchsafed.¹

Leaving the various difficulties of detail to be dealt with in the notes
on the passage, it is proposed here to discuss some of the general
grounds on which the credibility of the narrative as gi'ven by Tacitus
has been called in question.

The narrative brings in no other originating agency than that os Nero,
who, to divert the imputation from himself, ‘ sets up culprits ’ to sustain
the charge3 and the great difficulty of explaining how the Christiane
came to be selected for the purpose is either ignored or supposed to find
its solution in the fact that they were ‘ detested for their abomination: '‚
and notorious for ‘ hatred of the human race ', and were therefore presum-
ably persons against whom any charge could be believed, as well as being
sufficiently numerous to glut the public appetite sor vengeanoe. But
such an explanation seems only to increase the difficulty by its ωασπς
with the impression suggested from other sources; according to which
the Christian body in Rome at that date has been believed to have bem
neither considerable in numbers, nor so well known to the outer world
as to have aroused its hatred‚ or to have then incurred the imputationis
current no doubt in the age of Tacitus, but which he has been here
thought to have antedated. If suspicion had arisen or was sought to
be propagated, tracing the origin os the fire to an act of religious
fanaticism, its more natural objects would have been the Jews, who were

then living at Rome in very great numbers, and who as a body had ¹

twice at least before this tir'ne drawn down upon themselves the inter·
ference of the government,’ and whose religion is noticed with more

or less asperity by all the chief extant *writers of the Neronian period,³

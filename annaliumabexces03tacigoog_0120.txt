[10⁷]

even the legatus of Syria thinks, with the majority of his advisers there
present, that all atrocities and quarrels of barbarians were good sor
Roman interests‚ and that a king who owed his throne to a deed of
insamy would be more manageable than one who had reached it
honourably ¹: the legion sent into Armenia to restore order is hastily
withdrawn to avoid collision with the Parthians’: the garrison which
had betrayed Mithridates appears to have evacuated the country.⁸

The Parthian empire was now in the hands of the able and enter-

forces, and that Tiridates was undisputed king.¹⁸ The policy initiated

who had been set up as claimants sor the great king’s throne had

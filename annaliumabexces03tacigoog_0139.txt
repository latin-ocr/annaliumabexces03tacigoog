constant obligations must‘be acknowledged to Mommsen, Hist. v. ch. 53 to Hiibner's
treatise ‘ Das Romische Heer in Britannien’ (Hermes, xvi. 188 ι, pp. 514-584), and to
various notes in his edition of the inscriptions of Britain (C. 1. L. vii); to Professor
Rhys (‘ Celtic Britain,' London, 1882); and to many other worlts which are mentioned
in their place; also to information communicated by Mr. F. Haverfield.

Tan writings of Tacitus, even in the mutilated state in which we
now possess them, constitute our most complete and most consecutive
authority for the whole history of Roman invasion and conquest in
Britain down to the recall of Agricola (837, ann. 84), from whom it is
natural to suppose that most os his information respecting the country
and people was derived. It is here proposed, after a slight notice of
previous events, to enter into so much only of the subject as is comprised
in the period of the AnnaIS, so much, that is, as would have been
related in that work, if it had come down complete to us. An examin·

more properly to an edition of the Agricola. It is sufficient here to note

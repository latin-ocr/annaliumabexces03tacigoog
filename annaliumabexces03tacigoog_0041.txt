duced in respect of the vast revenues under the direct control of the
princeps.¹

On the division of the empire made by Augustus, the income of the
Caesarian provinces had been as matter of course received by him, no
doubt with some such understanding as existed with regard to the
‘ manubiae' of a general, that it should be expended on the public
service, and possibly subJ'ect to a formal liability to render account, had
any of his fictions of surrendering his imperium become a reality. As a
fact, some statement of accounts was made from time to time by Augustus
and his immediate successors,² ‚nor can it be doubted that he and they
observed a careful distinction between their ‘ patrimonium ' and the income
received in virtue os their office,⁸ though both alike were designated as
⁸ res suae,' ‘ res familiaris,' &c.,‘ and though there is no sufficient trace
of any central department of imperial finance‚⁸ which, so far as it was
centralized at all, must have been administered by the princeps personally.

It is apparently from the time of Claudius ⁶ that we begin to find used
in contrast to ‘ aerarium ⁹ the term ‘ fiscus ², or ‘ fiscus Caesaris ’ς and,
as the choice of this name would seem to have been determined by
its use under the Republic to denote the public store kept in the
treasury or sent from it to a magistrates* and under the early Empire
as a name for the exchequer of this or that separate province or
department,⁸ it had attached to it, notwithstanding its distinction from
the aerarium, the associations of a public fund of some sort.

Of greater significance is the increased importance assumed by the

Suet. (Aug. 101) speaks similarly of the
sum stored up (ι confiscata ') by Augustus
to pay his legacies.

Thus we find in inscriptions of the

early empire the expressions ⁸ fiscus
Asiaticus,’ ‘ Gallicus,' ‘ Iudaicus,’ ‘ fru-
mentariu5‚' etc. These several ⁶ fisci ’
are distinctly mentioned in Suet. Aug.

fiscis et vectigaliorum residuis ³).

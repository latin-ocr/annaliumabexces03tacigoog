1. doque eo, &a ‘ appeal should lie
to the consuls '. These appear to have
had, as a ‘potestas maior ‚ the right to
reverse decisions os other magistrates
(Momms. Staatsr. i. 2693 il. 101). An
instance is given by Val. Max. (7. 7, 6)
of the reversal os the praetor’s decision
in a civil suit by the consul Mamercus
Lepidus in 677, B. e. 77.

2. aedilium. On their number and
functions under the empire see Introd. i.
vi. p. 76. The penal powers here referred
to would belong to their ‘ cura urbis’,
which had been already curtailed by
Claudius (Suet. Cl. 38).

3. quantum . . . pignoris, dcc. ⁶ with-
in what limit they might distrain or fine ’.
The power οἱ ‘ pignoris capio ', or seizing
property in case os contumacy, is part oi
the general coercive power of magistrates
(see Momms. Staatsr. i. 160), and is
generally associated with that os fining
(cp. Varr. ap. Gen. ¹4· 7, 103 Liv. 37.
ἔέὶΐ ἑοὲῧᾰῑέἒέςὲὶὲι· ³²2²{331322‘5 3.ῗῖἐῖ
house (see note on 1 . 22, 1). We gather
from this passage (see also MommS. ii.
5¹ 3) that a higher limit was fixed for the
curule than sor the plebeian aediles The
form ‘aedilis plebeius' sor ‘aedilis plebi',
is noted by Momms. (ii. 471 , 3) as found
in F est. and in inseri tions; and perhaps
‘plebeii ’ should be ere read, as in 11.
24, 11.

4. et Helvidius. Most recent edd.
follow Gron. in readi ⁴ et ' sor ‘eo ’‚
which can hardly y'el a good sense.
The Helvidius Priscus now tribune can
hardly be the ‘legatus legionis ’ os five
years earlier (see ια. 49, 3, aud note). If
the famous person of the name (16. 28, α,
and note) is identical with this one, his

uaestorship must have been filled under

laudius rather than Nero ε the view that
he is addressed by Thrasea as ‘ iuvenis'
in 16. 35, 3, is perhaps mistaken.

Obultronium sabinum, mentioned
in H. 1. 37,6 as put to death in Spain
by Galba.

5. contentiones proprias, ‘ a per·
sonal dispute,’ in contrast to these

tribunes with the collection ot' dues for
the treasury‚ but chiefly by extorting

permit a delectus to be held. See Liv.

been ⁴ auderet ¹, and Ricklefs would read
‘ageret ’. Both are unu . ε the
text can well bear the meaning that he
‘ stretched his right ’‚ though no strictly
parallel instance appears to be found.

7. curam tabularum publicarum,
i. e. care of the public account&

praefectos. These persons, who were
senators os praetorian rank (c. 29, 3), are
designatedin inscriptions (C. 1. L. 3. 4013,
{3ssssss Ὕῗέεὲοῗὲεἵ ssffisseffi
made at this time is suggested (see
Momms. i. 277, 4) by the fact that as
‘ praefecti ’ officers of Caesar) they would
be indepen ent os such intersereuce ou
the part os a tribune as is here mentioned.
The alleged reason is given in c. ²9· 3.

9. Varie habita, δια, ‘the regulation
of that department had been in different
hands and had been osten changed': cp.

(H. 4. 8, 3), &c. whole chapter

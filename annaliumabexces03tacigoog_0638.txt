Andresen thinks that the true reading is
‘ coetum frequentem ⁹, ‘ frequenter' ac-
cording to him having been altered not to
‘frequentis’ but to ‘frequentem '. But
‘ coetus’ has remained unchanged‚ and it is
extremely doubtful whether the correction
is the sign convertin ‘e’ to ‘em’ and not
the letter ‘ s ‘. —F .] he plural denotes the

Demetrio· This philosopher is fre-
quently mentioned with great admiration
by Seneca, who in one place (de Ben- 7.
8, 2) speaks of him asraised up to instruct
and reproach the age, in another (Ep. 229)
calls him ⁴ non praeceptor veri sed testis ;
and again says (E . 62, 3), ‘ quidni
admirer ‘2 Vidi nihi ei deesse! Philo-
stratus who speaks of him (vit. Ap. 4.
25) as teaching at Corinth, and as a
strong opponent of Apollonius, calls him
ἀνὴρ συνειληφὼς πᾶν τὸ ἐν Kitron-fi κράτος.
We find him in H. 4. 40, 5 stooping
unworthily to defend Egnatius Celer (see
c. 32, 2); but he is noted for having
said to Nero (Arr. Ep. 1. 25, υ), ἁπαλω-
μοι θάνατον, σοὶ δ’ ἡ φύσις, and for free
speech to Vespasian, who replied κύνα
ὕλακτοῦντα οὐ φονεύω, but exiled him
with other philosophers in 824, Α. 1). 71

cynicos institutionis. This school,
which had been the precursor of the
Stoic, but had been eclipsed by it, at
this time and afterwards regained some
prominence. See uv. 13, 121, and the
wmngtz gffql’ssebat ' t cp.
‘ex quo est coniectare' (Gell. 6. 6, 11).
Nipp. notes that the only other prose
instances of this Graecism, so frequent in
Latin poets, are ‘ est videre ’ (G. 5, 4) and
‘ negare sit' (Liv. 42. 41, 2).

Such subjects of ’dis'cussign xissuld’ not

The belief of Thrasea on immortality
may be gethered from the saying quoted
in note on c. 35, 3, that of Tacitus from

‘ queritor ’ is only known in the participle,
and even in that form questioned. Its
use in the fifth century by Paulinus No-
lanus gives but slender authority for it,
and, though it occurs in MSS. oi Liv. 39.

all older edd. of Plin. Pan. ²9 (‘nequiquam
queritantibus sociis ’), it has been altered
by all edd. after Drakenborch in the
former author, and by recent edd. in the
latter, to the participle os the better known
‘quiritare’. The same alteration has
been made here (after the suggestion of ,

by the imperative character of the sen·

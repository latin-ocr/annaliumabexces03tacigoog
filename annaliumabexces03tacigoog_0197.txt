1. sed quaestores, &a The tra-
dition os the origin os quaestors varies
much. Ulpian (Dig. 1, 13) cites Julius
Gracchanus, the contempora and friend
os C. Gracchus, as stating ⁸ omulum et
Numam Pompilium binos quaestores ha-
buisse, quoa ipsi non sna voce sed populi
suff ‘o crearent‘, and adds that a more
prevrffint tradition ascribes their institu-
tion to Tullus Hostilius. This view no
doubt assumes the identity os ⁸ quaestores
parricidii ’ with the ‘ duumviri perduellio·
nis os Liv. 1. 26, 5. Plutarch states
(Poplic. 1 s. 103) that Valerius Poplicola,
in the first year of the Republic, estab-
lished the treasury, and gave the peo le
the right of electing two uaestors o it.

statement of Zonaras (7. 13, p. 336),
presumably from Dio Cassius, that the
old ‘ quaestores parricidii ' acquir-ed, at
the beginning οἱ the Republic, additional
functions as ‘ quaestores aerarii ’, and came
in time to and to bedesignated by
those sun ons only. For asull discussion

a. lex curiata. On this act, ywhich
the ⁸ imperium ’ was conferred on the
elected m ‘ tratcs, see Mommsen,
Staatsr. i. . , foll. Thatof L. Brutus,
to which 'lPacitus appears to refer as still
extant ‚in his day, would a‘p arently be
that by which the election o t first con·
suls was ratified and their wers defined ς
and it is implied in the sol owing sentence
(⁸ mansitque . . . deligendi ') that this old
⁴ lex ’ recited that the ltin had appointed

uaestors, and empowere the consuls to
go so. Hence it would appear that

Gracchanus (whom Plutarch in this point
followed) was misled by party spirit in
making them to have been always ώσω
by the people.

3. nusum, either ‘ renewed' (cp. 4.
26, 4), or ‘carried back over the past'
(cp. 3. 33, ι), i.e. with precedents cited.

the ‘comitia tributa’, to which these
lawa gave extended powers, was always
the assembly by which quaestors were
elected (Momms. p. 525).

6. ut rem militarem comitarentur,

term to ‘res familiaris’ . Livy, who
places this doubllng os e quaestors in

edly right in giving an opposite account
to that of Tacitus of the comparative an·

Tacitus should have given an account ο(
the original functions of the quaestor-s,
where he is speaking os the chan from
consular nomination to po ular ection,
unless he is to be supposed) to mean that
this was also the date when their military
duties began, and that as these came to
engross more of their time, two others
were added to ensure due performance ο(
the original urban duties. Or perhaps.
as Mommsen (Staatsr. ii. p. 562, 2) sug-
gests, we should read thus, ‘ post . . . ex-

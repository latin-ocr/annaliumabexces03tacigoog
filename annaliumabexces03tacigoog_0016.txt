anPJ] TEXT oF THE MEDJCEAN MS. [3]

but none of them can claim any earlier date than the 'middle of the r5th
century. Many are known not to have been direct transcripta os the
Medicean, and very few are even supposed to be such. The best known
of them are classed by Walthet and Ruperti in two main groups. The
one consists of five ¹ expressly stated to have been transcribed from a
‘ Codex Genueusis’ now lost, and a sixth ⁸, the text of which closely
resembles theirS. Another group of six ', called by Walther (with less
propriety) the Roman group, shows traces of a common exemplar,
distinct from the ‘ Genuensis ⁹. To these a third group should be added
comprising two Florentine manuscripts in the Laurentian Library ⁴,
which appear to approach most nearly to the Medicean text. The
affinities of the others ⁸ have not been traced.

Respecting the source of the ⁴ Genuensis ’ and other parents of these
MSS. nothing can now be known. It should however be noted that the
loss of the two leaves in the First and Second Books of the Histories ⁸ had
certainly taken place before 154a,⁷ and may have been one of the mutila-
tions complained of by Bracciolini in 1428 ’ς but the lost matter is
preserved in all the inferior manuscripts ⁹. This would show that the
Medicean, if it is their ultimate source, had been already transcribed
before this mutilation happened to it ; and it is also evident from the

correspondence that some other copy of Tacitus had been seen by
Bracciolini ¹⁰. An alternative theory, that these MSS. were not derived
from the Medicean, but from some other old MS. coordinate with it and

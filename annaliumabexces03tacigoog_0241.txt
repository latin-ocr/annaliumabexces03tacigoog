hostis ingrueret. The use of this
verb of rsons (cp. c. 30, 13 1. 27, a: 15.

eminence, the more natural Roman ground

of the remark is suited to the age of
renewed military glory under Trajan.
‘Per otium ' is so used for ‘in time of
peace’ in 15. 6, 2ς and ‘industrius' and
‘ ignavus' have here special reference to

Ritter considers that the lacuna could not

with Nipperdey to take no notice of the
lacuna. A verb or 'ei le of thinking

with Apameia by Seleucus Nicator, e
founder of both towns (ΡΙ. N. H. 5. 24,

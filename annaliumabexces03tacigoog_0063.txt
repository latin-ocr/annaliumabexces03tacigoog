‘ tutela ⁹ of Asconius Labe0,¹¹ and to have at this time received instruc-
tion from two persone, one of whom, named Burrus, must have known
Greek,⁸ while the other was the ingenious but utterly profligate and
unscrupulous AnicetnS.⁴ The perils to which his own exalted rank,
no less than his instrumentality, however passive, in his mother's
schemes‚ exposed him, were skilsully turned to account by surrounding
his boyhood with a halo of legend, and describing the assassins sent
by Messalina as scared away by tutelary serpents.⁸ The sympathy
enlisted by this and other such devices, manifesting itself in an unmis-
takable preponderance of applause in favour of the grandson of
Germanicus on his first public appearance with his younger rival
Britannicus in the ‘ludus Troiae ' at the secular games,⁸ would naturally
have increased his danger, had not Messalina been turned from her
schemes of vengeance by the keener passion ⁷ which in the next year
impelled her to her death.

exaltation of his mother; who, though all her schemes centred in his
advancement, disciplined him with the full force of her imperious
nature,⁸ and, seeing that at this stage of his life the prestige of an
education which none could hope to rival would be above all things
helpsul to him, lost no time in placing him under the instruction of
the greatest literary genius of the age ⁹ ; who, being besides indebted

probably three or sonr years before the
Christian era, he had been brought in
childhood to Rome, where his father the
rhetorician had reached equestrian rank.

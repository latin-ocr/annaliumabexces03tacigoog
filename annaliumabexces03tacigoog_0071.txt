Elsewhere, our only record of foreign or provincial affairs is that
better appointments seem to be made, and imperial interests seem more
cared sor than under the later Claudian rule. Veranius, from whom
much was expected, succeeds Didius in Britain, and on his speedy death
is succeeded at the close of this period by Suetonius Paulinus¹ ; a new
legatus of Lower Germany takes prompt action against occupations of
territory previously overlooked ’ς a corrupt practice by which provincial
governors managed to win condonation sor their iniquities by indulging

the first and most striking assertion os a purpose, more or less present
in all ‚his extravagances, of ruling by popular support. His
advisers, while prudently dissuading him from this headlong impulse,

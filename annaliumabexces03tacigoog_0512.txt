title of proconsuls (see on 1. 74, 1).
‘ Proconsul legatusve ’ appear to be more
commonly used (Momms. Staatsr. ii. 243,
3). The position of ‘ve’ is in accordanee
with the practice of Tacitus and others
to trent such terms as two words (‘ pro

14. 47, 3. It appears from Philost. 4.

The fact that neither its destruction nor
the earthquake are noted as divine por«
teuts, though similar occurrences are
constantly so designated, shows the
ambiguous attitude os Tacitus on this
sub'ect.

4J. motu unae, διε. This earthquake,
sixteen years before the eruption which
destroyed the town, is mentioned by
Seneca (Nat. Quaest. 6. 1, 1), ‘ Pompeios

the names of the consuls in Seneca have

6. Laelia, thought by Nipp. to have
been a daughter of Laelius Balbus (6. 47,
1), and the Laelia for whom Domitius
Afer (see 4. 52, 1) made a speech, from
which Quint. quotes (9. 4, 31).

7. Cossorum, possibly a daughter of
the consul mentioned in 14. πο, 1. On
the selection of Vestals and the use of
the term ‘ capere’ see 2. 86, 1, and note.

Rufo. The full names are ‘C. Memmio

Rufo ². The former was son of the person
whose death and character are recorded
in 14. 47, 1; the latter, one of the most
famous men of his age, is chiefly known
from his conduct as governor of Upper
Germany in A. D. 68 (see Appendix to
Book 16), and is frequently mentioued
in the Histories. He received a second
consulship from Vitellius, and a third
from Nerva in A. D. 97, in which year hc
died, and was succeeded by Tacitus, who

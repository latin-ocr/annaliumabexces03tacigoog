et magistratus, διο. That the
higher magistrates ot* the year, consuls
(see Mommsen. Staatsr. ii. p. 136) and
praetors (see ι. 15, 53 77, a). had the
duty of presiding at public games, would
be too well known to the readers of
Tacitus to need his mentioning it; and
⁴ potissimum ' would have been a weak
word in such a statement, and ‘caeri-
moniae' (see 1. 54, 1, &c. inapplioeble
to other duties than those o a priesthood.
Nipp. appears therefore right in suppos-
ing that Tacitus is explaining why his
praetorship added to his prominence (as
quindecimvir) on the occasion mentioned.
‘ The quindecimviri (asa body) had os old
the char e os these
them as appened to be magistrates were
selected by preference (rather than others
os the body) sor the public performance
of religious duties'

1. sedente, ‘being present at.’ Nipp.
gives several instances of this sense from
Cic.. διο. His presence a pears to be
mentioned as making the emonstration
more significant.

circensibus ludis. One of the days
of the ‘ludi saeculares' was given to
circensian games (see Plin. N. H. 8. 42,
65, 1603 Suet. Dom. 4). The ‘ludi
Taurii ⁹, at which Varro (L. L. 5, 154)
mentions horse-taces iu the Flaminian
circus, are not, according to Marquardt,
rightly identified with the ‘ saeculares '.

a. ludicrum Troiae. This spectacle
is well known from its description in
Verg. Aen. 5. 545, soll. It had certainly
been held by Sulla (Plut. Cat. Min. 3,
760), and was probably οἱ very ancient

games, and such of

ori in (see Marqu. iii. 525), but was espe-
cia ly taken up by the early caesara, no
doubt as associated with the claim of the
Julii to Trojan descent.

Britannicus . . . 10. Domitius,
both here first mentioned in the extant
Books: the latter indeed would seem
from the words describing him not to
have been previously mentioned at all.
Most authorities, except Vergil (see
Marqu. l. 1.), represent the boys as divided
into two ⁸ turmae’, called those os the
⁸ maiores' and ‘ minores ² (Suet. Iul. 39),
the former a parently under sixteen, the
latter under e even years old; this distinc-
tion οἱ age perhaps taking the place os oue

(MommS. Staatsr. iii. 31). Prinees ot
the imperial house seem to have taken

have grown out of the discovery in Nero's
bed os a serpent’s cast skin. which he long
wore, enclosed in a golden bracelet, as a
charin. Itis also to be noted that the Ge-
nius of a place (see Verg. Aen. 5, 95), pos-
sibly sometimes also that of a person,was
represented in form of a serpent, and that
it may have been under this idea that such
cultus was paid to these se nte, as ap—

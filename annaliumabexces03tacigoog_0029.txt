that he had read his character rightly: ‘ He would have Sulla’s vices with·
out his virtues: ² ‘ He would be a serpent to the Roman people, a
‚Phaethon to the world! ⁸

The old man would gladly have so ordered the succession ' as to set
aeide the adoptive grandson for the grandson by blood ς but the knowledge
that Tiberius Gemellus was too young, and that in any case the tide of
popular favour would run high sor the son os Germanicus, led him to leave
the future to take its own course, though he could see from the scowl
with which the elder looked on the younger what that course would be.⁴

Gaius again had shrewdness enough to see that, whether Tiberius l
intended to attempt to provide for the succession or not, the real masters of
the situation were the praetorians, and that their praefect would be his best
ally. Nor was Macro in his turn slow to ‘ worship the rising instead of the
setting sun ', and even to sacrifice his wife's honour to cement the alliance.‘

All could see the direction in which affairs were tending3 and the
eminent senator, L. Arruntius, is represented as choosing immediate
suicide, rather than await a more rigorous slavery, under the rule of an
ignorant youth ‘ brought up under the vilest influences, with Macro to
guide him ’θ

The end came in due course, not without dark stories of the personal
share of Macro and Gaius in its acceleration⁷3 and from this point the
guidance of Tacitus is lost to us.

We are led however to believe, from what has been already noted,

 

that Tacitus would have regarded his subsequent conduct, as he has that
of TiberiuS, as that of a natural tendency revealing itself, though by less
gradual stach, on the mere removal of ensorced disguise. We should
suppose him to have entirely disbelieved that the popular acts and pro-
fessions of the young prince at the beginning of rule showed any sincere
intention to govern justly and moderately‚ or that the succeeding insanity,
whatever its nature and degrec,⁸ which by most accounts was as much
the effect as the cause of reckless profligacy, had any other effect on his
moral character than so far as it led him more completely to drop the

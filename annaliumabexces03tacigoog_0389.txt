ilico defendi postulabat, ‘was de-
manding to be heard at once in defenoe.'
A similar construction with ‘ postulo ’ is
found in 2, 50, ²3 H. 4. 2, 3, &c.; also
in Cic. Verr. 3. 60, 138, and in other
writers.

6. Paulinus Pompeius et Ι.. Vetus.
The latter, on whom see c. 11, 1, and
note, had the Upper Province3 Paulinus.
the legatus of the Lower. is mentioned
again as a consular in 15. 18, 4, and was
father, or pei-ha brother, of Pompeia
Paulina, the wi e of Seneea (15. 60, 8).
Pliny, who mentions him aa taking a
quantity of plate with him to an army

surronnded by savage tribes, states (N. H.
33. 11, 50, 143) that he was the son of a
knight of Arelate (Arles). Seneca dedi·
cates his treatise ‘ De brevitate vitae ’,
written in or before AD. 49 (see note on
12. 23, 5), to a Paulinus, who appears
from it (18, 3) tohavebeenthen ‘praefectus
annonae ', and may have been the eque·-

Drusus died in 745, nc. 93 whence it
would appear that the work of Paulinus
was taken up in mn. 55. Vetus, who
was consul in that year (c. 11, 1), may
have been sent to Germany when his
suffectus succeeded him, and appears to
have only held bis province for a year
from that date (see on c. 56, 4).

9. assgerem.. This dam is that men·
tioned in H. 5. 19, 3, as constructed to
prevent inundations on the Gallie side.
Thierry (Hist. des Gaul. iii. p. 439) sup·
poses it to have been constructed at the
bifurcation of the old Rhine and the wal
(see 2. 6, 5), and to have been intended
to keep up the supply of water in the
former, with which the canal of Drusus
(2. 8, 1) communicated.

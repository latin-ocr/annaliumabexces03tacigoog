anP. ιιι] RULE OF CLAUDIUS

[37]

at the shortlived addition of letters to the alphabet,² the affectation of
archaic spelling? the attempt to rescue from deserved decay the obsolete
lore of the aruspices,⁸ might also have the satisfaction of pointing out
that their august professor did not after all know the ancient meaning of
the term ⁸ libertinus ’,⁴ and had sorgotten his own researches on the
computation of an Etruscan ‘ saeculum ’.⁸

Again, much as we may set down to a conscientious intention to
discharge a public duty, and to a desire of emulating Augustus,⁸ we
must ascribe also in no small degree to vanity and sels-conceit that
passion for the personal exercise of judicial functions which all authorities
attest,⁷ and which, notwithstanding the record that many of his decisions
. were shrewd and original,⁸ and that some of the principles of law
embodied in his judgements or legislative enactments are quoted with
approval long afterwards by J‘uristic writers‚⁰ could not have worked
generally sor the public benefit. Even in ordinary cases such encroach-
ment by the princeps in Rome and by his procurators elsewhere ²⁰ on
the ordinary tribunals was an injudicious weakening of their authority3
nor could all the assiduity of Claudius prevent accumulation of arrears
and harassing delays, shortened (if we are to believe our authors) by very
summary modes os expedition 3 ¹¹ while, in cases involving graver chargeS,
‘ a prince who centred in himself all functions of law and magistracy’ ¹¹
was but calling into existence and enriching aerowd of accusers to whom
condemnatione and collusive acquittals alike were profitable.¹⁸ They
felt they had only to study the humours of a single person, devoid of

given of his eensorial acts, os his fifty
edicta in one day, aud of the grotesque-
ness of some of them.

enar. ιιι] RULE or· NERO [59]

encouraged no doubt, and probably prompted, his bids for popularity
in other directions, such as the largesses already mentioned,¹ the assign-
ment of public land to veterans to recruit the decaying population of
Italian towns? the confidence shown in the populace by the withdrawal
of the guard from the theatre,⁸ the erection of a new amphitheatre sor
the favourite amusement os the city.⁴

Sustained by such measures, and by the renown and victories of
Corbulo, the new government was no doubt winning golden opinions
on every side3 and it is probably to this combination of an energetic
and successful foreign policy with an outwardly upright and popular
home government, that these years of Nero owe the emphatic encomium
given them by his great successor Trajan, as a period with which no
other since the foundation os the principate could stand comparison.⁸
To those who study the history aa we have it, such high praise is
hard to justify3 nor would it seem as if Tacitus meant us to regard
it as more than a period in which evil tendencies were kept somewhat
in check, or skilsully concealed.⁸

Such a view becomes eminently true, if we look at the development
during this period of Nero’s own character; of which even the best
side stood in startling eontrast to any ideal of a Roman autocrat.
Youth might indeed excuse mere frivolity, such as that which made
him at once on becoming princeps place himself under the instruction

own speeches and edicts,⁸ and spend his time in a round of amateur
attempts at engraving, painting, singing, driving, varied at intervals
by fits os verse-making.⁹ Yet, even this would wear a graver aspect,
as men got to know that some os these pursuits had taken such hold ’
on him, that his one ambition, restrained as yet by his mother’s
influence, was to exhibit his talent in public.¹⁰ Still more ominous
was it to hear that the ruler of the Roman world roamed the streets
aster dark with a band of rioterS, wounding and beating quiet people,

Nipp. in thus correcting the Med. ‘tabu-
las iis ’ (corrected by a later hand to
‘ tabulariis ’). Many edd. retain the
Med. text; but ‘ iis’ as a dative seems
here to have no force. Ritt. alters ‘ iis'
to ‘ consciis ⁹, which is somewhat more
difficnlt to extract from the Med. text.
Halm, On, and Dr. read ‘ ascitis ⁹,

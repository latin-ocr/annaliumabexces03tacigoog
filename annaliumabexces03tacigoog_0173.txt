' found under the Republic‚ in which sena·
tors received the honorary distinction
(⁴ ornamenta' or ‘insignia') os a hi her
rank than they had attained (Dio, 3 . 40
[2 3], 4). The practice os giving such to
persons who were not senators at all but
(as in this case) knights, is stated to have
originated with the gift of ‘ praetoria
ornamenta ’ to Seianus by Tiberius (Dio,

The ex-

the mere arrest (c. 1, 3). and to Sosibius,
the subordinate accuser (c. 1, 2), are to be

stated,must have been much luget.

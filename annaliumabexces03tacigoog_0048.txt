cnsp. 111] RULE OF CLAUDIUS [35]

not without foundation in so far as the scheme of government was even
at the outset impracticable or inconsistently carried out, and passed
into a system showing manifold special vices of its own as time went on.

In the first place, it must have been plain to all who had insight, that
the professed return to the Augustan idea of a dual government shared
between the princeps and the senate was not really a bona fide restoration
of what even at its best had been in many important points no more
than a fiction.¹ The senate, shattered by a reign of terror of almost
ten years' continuone duration‚¹ had neither the prestige nor the moral
dignity to resume its lost position3 nor have we any record of such
discussion of public questions as is· found in the best years of TiberiuS,⁸
or even such as the policy of the early Neronian government⁴ and the
independence of individual senators· <as Thrasea ⁸) combined to realize
for a short time afterwards, It was therefore no less perhaps from the
necessity of the case than from the deliberate intention to encroach, that
the political importance of the emperor's own functionaries is now so
greatly augmented‚ and that from this period is mainly to be dated a
new departure in the system of government‚ by which more and more of
the work of the state is taken out of the hands of the senate and its
magistrates„ and knights, or freedmen‚ as ministers of the emperor and
responsible to him alone, are found presiding over new departments
of state at home‚⁶ or with increased power and independence throughout
the empirel' Again‚ the circumstances under which Claudius had attained
his power had stamped a character upon it and formed a precedent.

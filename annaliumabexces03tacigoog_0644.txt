May 24, and carried the place by storm on the forty-seventh day of the
siege,¹ and had purposed to send Josephus to Rome, but was induced
to retain him in honourable custody.¹ Joppa‚ Tiberias, Taricheae,
Gamala, Gischala, were either surrendered or taken by storm in the
course of this ycar's campaign, by the end of which all Galilee and the
North were' reduced.⁸ Meanwhile the population of Jerusalem had been
swelled by various country hands, through whom the fanatical party had
got more and more the upper hand. Disunion was everywhere prevalent;
no single leader obtained general recognition3 and things were rapidly
drifting into the state of anarchy and confusion in which they were
found at the beginning of the actual siege.⁴

For the rest of this year we have little more than a narrative of Nero's
doings in Greeoe. The calendar had been altered, so as to make all the

dignified or unmanly, and affected to conform to all rules of the profession,
and to stand in fear of the decision of the Judges.⁸ He attained, as a
matter of course, the honours of a περιοδονίκης ; ⁷ the names of the famous
musicians Terpnus, Diodorus, and Pammenes being mentioned among
those defeated by him 3⁸ and he is stated to have given large sums to the
Hellanodicae for their decision, and to the Pythia for a felicitous prophecy,
but to have taken vengeance on the adytum of Apollo for some fancied
insult.⁸ He entered himself also (employing the consular Cluvius
Rufus as his herald) in the local contests of au Greek citie8‚ except Sparta
and Athens, deterred in the former case (as was supposed) by the as-
sociations of the laws of LycurguS, in the latter by the sear of the
Erinnyes‚¹⁰

It is stated that he also pillaged the cities and temples of their works
of art, carrying off 500 statues from Delphi alone 3 ¹¹ also that he put to

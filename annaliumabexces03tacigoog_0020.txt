he had owed so much, and Macro’s wife, Ennia, to whom he had
formerly promised marriage.¹ The scandal of his open incest with
Drusilla was yet further increased by his demanding her deification and
other extravagant honours at her death.¹

By this time the treasury had been emptied by lavish expenditure of
all kinds, especially by unparalleled magnificence in public entertainments.
Gaius was thus driven to replenish his sunds by confiscation3 and
numbers are stated to have been selected for condemnation, really on
the ground of their wealth, ostensibly on such charges as that of having

antipathy of the Jews to this cultus was made the occasion for a ferocious

Puteoli to Baiae ; apparently for the mere purpose of crossing and
recrossing it in a triumphal pageant.¹⁴ Other schemes of a more practical

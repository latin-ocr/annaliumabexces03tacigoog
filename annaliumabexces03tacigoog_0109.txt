Nora—This subject has lately received fun treatment from Mommsen (Hist. ν.
ch. 9), to whose work the reader must be generally referred, and to whom constant
obligations must be acknowledged. Information has also frequentlybeen derived stom
the same author’s notes on the ‘ Res Gestae Divi Augusti ¹ (‘Monumentum Ancyra·
num ’), and from Prof. Rawlinson's ⁸ Sixth Great Oriental Monarchy ⁹ (London, 1873).
The chronology and geography of the campaigns of Corbulo have been most carefully
investigated in Egli’s work31 and great light has been thrown on the general chronology
of the Parthian kings by the evidence of their coinage, on which the latest authority is
that of Prof. Percy Gardner (⁶ N nmismata Orientalia.’ Pt. ν. London, 1877), from whom

the dates of their reigns here given are taken!¹ [Referenee should also be made to
Henderson’s ⁶ Nero ’.--P.]

mouth. There is however a complica·
tion from the lunar mode of reckoning·
and an clement of uncertainty arises from
the fact that tn most cases the name given
on coins is only‘ Arsaces} and the suc·
cession of a new king has to be deter-

Asnaum.

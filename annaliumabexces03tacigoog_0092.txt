give colour to a charge against Anteius ¹3 personal prowess 3ηά soldierly
qualities to the same charge against Ostorius ⁸: a letter purporting to be
written by Lucan is fatal to his father Mela? whose own alleged words

Tigellinus is able to avenge himself on Thermus for his freedman’s libe1‚⁸
and even, by a mere suggestion os friendship with Scaevinus,⁸ to rid
himself of the rival who, in the line in which alone he himself was
famous, must have sar stu-passed him, C. Petronius, who had spent an
energy oepable of better things ' on the accomplishment os pleasure3
wherein his refined air of careless ease and simplicity, contrasted with
the coarse profusion os ordinary debauchees: gave his taste a character
for originality, and made the stamp of his approval necessary before any
suggestion os luxury could commend itsels to Nero as sufficiently
rec-hereb! to deserve his notice.¹⁰ Petronius died as he had lived,
turning from both the shists and the consolatium of other men ¹¹ as
he had disdained their commonplace pleasures, and sending to Nero,
in place os the usual last words of flattery,¹⁸ a stinging exposure
of his vilest, and, as he had hitherto flattered himself, his most secret
profligacies.¹⁸ · -

sor the monotony os his subject, and to bespeak some indulgence for
the tame submission os those whom he regards as rather the victims
of satality than of wilful cowardice.¹⁴ It is more pertinent to ask what

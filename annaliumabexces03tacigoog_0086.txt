lives in numbers,² and reduced thousands to homelessness, was due to
a mere freak of his outrageous wantonness.

Such sparks could always kiudle a conspiracy² ; and the schemers of
a lower stamp who thought that their opportunity was come, could band
themselves with genuine patriots,³ ready to dare anything to free the
Empire from a monster. Actual conspirators are generally few, and
were so, as far as we have means of knowing,⁴ in the present case ; but
a small band of resolute men might easily, as in the case of Gaius, find
their opportunity; and their real hope of success lay in the manifold sup-
port which they had ground for expecting afterwards. It wasat that date
a bold step to seek a successor for Nero altogether outside the family of
Augustus3 but the man of their choice, C. Piso,⁸ would commend him-
self to the nobles and senate by his ripe age ⁶ and exalted lineage,' and
to various classes by his forensic eloquence exercised on the weaker side,
his wealth and bountiful gifts, his winning courtesy and handsome per·
son; while those who hated the cruelty alone of the Neronian rule, and
liked its moral laxity, might be assured that in him they had no strait-
laced rule to sear.⁸ They might count thus on many chances of his
acceptance; although they had no support to expect from the most
respectable section of the nobility, the party of Thrasea and Soranus, too
uncompromising in their opposition to monarchy as such to plot for a
change of masters? least of all for that from one voluptuary to another;
and although they had to guard against the more dynastic minds who
might favour the young Silanus,¹⁰ or bold spirits like the consul Vestinus,

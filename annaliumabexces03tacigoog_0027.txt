Tm: few seattered allusione in the extant works of Tacitus to the rule
of Gaius and events which occurred under it receive some light from
what is said in the first six Books of his earlier lise and the circumstances
which tended to form his character up to the time when he assumed the
government.

We hear of him as, at two years old, the unconscious sharer m the
pei-ils of the German mutiny, carried off 1n his mother’s arms' to find a
safer refuge among the Treveri than in the heart of the Roman legions,³
We are also given to understand that the sight of the ⁴ sosterchild of the
legions ’,⁴ wearing the tiny sandal modelled on that of the common soldier
of the ranlts,⁸ contributed most of all to the revulsion of feeling that
turned the arms of the mutineers, in rude camp justice, against each
other.⁸ The incident had not escaped the watchsul eyes of Tiberius, or
of Seianus, who nursed the seeds of suspicion in his master’s mind, as to
the motives of a mother who could allow a Caesar to bear such a nick-
name as ‘ Caligula ’,‘'. one which, we may believe, long stood him in good
stead in the mind of the soldiers. -

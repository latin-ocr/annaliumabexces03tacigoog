1. navali stagno, the Naumachia in
the Trans-Tiberine quarter: see 12. 56, 1,
mingbenventiouln, ⁸ places of resort.⁹

55, 13 H. 5. 12, 33 also (with‘ rerum')
H. 2. 16, 6. The same form of the word

is found in Col„ Luc„ Pl. ma„ but the
more usual form is ‘ conluvio ’.

The word is rare and appears to have this
sense elsewhere only in very late authors.
veno: cp. 13. 51, 1, and note; for
⁸ luxui’ a genit. would be more usual in
classica} prose (see Introd. i. v. 5 19).

3. stipes, ‘ largaeses,’ given by Nero
to be spent then and there. It seems best
sossto take it, with Em.; but Marquardt
(iii. 142) prefers to follow Lips. in taking
it to mean contributione from the public,
whigh is certainly the usual sense of the
wo .

necessitate, because it was expected
os them so to spend the gift (causal abl.).
Suet. mentions (Aug. 98) a largess given
by Augustus to his friends with a com-
mand to spend it in a particular way.

4. gloria, ‘from vanity’; so used in
causal abl. in 1. 8, 2. Nipp. and Dr.
take it as a modal abl. (‘ostentatiously’);
but it seems best to make it correspond to
‘necessitate ’.

5. neo ulla, ecc. It is plain that
Tacitus does not mean to compare this
⁴ conluvies' with others, but with other
causes of corruption. Hence Madvig
(Λᾶν. διιὶρ. p. 232) thinks that ‘vis' or
‘ tis’ s ould be inserted before ⁴ plus '.

he text may however be taken, with
Nipp., as an instance os attraction (sor
⁸ neque quidquam ’), though somewhat
harsher than the instances which he gives
(e. g. Sen. Ben. 2. 1, 2 ⁸ cum in beneficio
iucundissima sit tribuentis voluntas').

circumdedit: so ‘circumdare gra-
tiam’ (c. 53, 5), ‘famam’ (H. 4. 11, 3).
Dr. shows that the expression is equiva-

lent to such Greek phrases as περιτιθέναι
τινὶ ἀτιμίαν, &c.

6. conluviee, so used in c. 44, 53 2.

of ‘ postremum ' by the first hand: Halm
reads ‘ postremum' and in his app. en’t.

‘facies'3 the supposition being that the
word was originally written ‘ ffiaseis‘, from
which the ⁴ δ’ had dropped out, and the
correction being supported by Suet. Ner.
25, who describes him,apparently in later
time, as never speaking to soldier-s or
other gutherings ‘nisi astante phonasco ’.
The oldest edd. read ‘ familiaribus’; others
retain the Med. text, placing a suu stop
after ‘ adsistentibus’ (which is taken as
a concise abl. aba), and taking ‘ facies‘ to
mean ⁴ a remarkable appearanee’ (cp. 1.
41, 1; H. 2. 89, 3, &c.). Madvig (Λᾶν.
Supp. p. 233) would take the passage in
the same way but place the stop before
‘adsistentibus ξ. Ritt. brackets ‘adsisten-
tibus facies’ as an exclamatur-y gloss
interpolated into the text. ‘ Accesserat’
is read by all edd. after Lips. for Med.
‘ abscesserat ’.

and yet applauding.' On this quasi·

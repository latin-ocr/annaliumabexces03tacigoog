a stronger sense than that of ⁶ uncon-
ciliatory' : cp. 4. 52, 3, and note.

1. imperatores, those os the confronted
armies (c. 8, 6). Nipp. notes that Tad-
tus appears so to style Gotarzes and Var-
danes, as neither was indisputably ⁴ rex ² ς
though the term might be used even os

foedus iaciunt: so in Med. Nipp.
reads, with MS. Agr. ⁴ iciunt' (on which
form see his note), others (aster Lips.)
‘ faciunt ¹. The Med. text would be taken
to mean ⁶ sermones iaciunt (cp. 4. 68, 4,
διε.) de foedere ’, and would be a con·
densed expression somewhat like ⁶ termi-
nos iaciebat’ in 6. 31, 2. Cp. 15. 50, 1.
Walther rightly points out that only the
first overtures are here spoken of.

2. mutauit, aorist: cp. ι. 53, 5, and
αξ. cunctanter: cp. 2. 64, 5; 4. ²2, 2,

complexi dextra. The eeremony
usual on these occasions is described in

4. mutare. with inf„ as in 14. 31, 4.
Dr. cites also Liv. 43. 21, 3.

5. potior. Dr. notes that this word
here takes the construction of ‘ aptus ’,
‘idoneus't no other instance appears to
occur.

6. penitus . . . abitt. On the sugges·
tion of Mommsen, that the inscription
found in Kurdistan (C. I. G. 4674) to a
rarrdpsnr σατράπης τῶν σατραπῶν may, if
it refers to this Gotarzes, designate a
‘tion of eminence reserved to him on
is rg‘signation os the kingdom, see Introd.

and that the recovery must be dated in

mention of Vibius Marsus as legatus os

this distraction that gave Gotarzes hia

2. 74, ῐ, and note. It would appear (see

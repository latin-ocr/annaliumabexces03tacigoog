Nero meanwhile was acting with the greatest wealmess and indecidua-
He is stated to have at first wholly disregarded the news of the rising of
Vindex, and even to have professed his joy at the opportunity offered for
extortion from the GauIS.⁴ After eight days ⁸ spent in all his usual amuse-
ments at N aples, he returned to Rome and issued a proclamation.⁸ Then
he was thrown into consternation by the news that Galba had been pro-
claimed emperor, and was receiving general support! Some show was
now made of vigour, and the available troops were collected by reoening
the forces already on their way to the Cauoesus· and to Aethiopia,⁹ sum-

Crispinilla to instigate Claudius Macer, the imperial legatus in Africa, to
ensure the fidelity of Rome by threatening it with famine '.¹⁴ “ The news

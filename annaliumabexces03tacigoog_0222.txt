SPEECH oF CLAUDIUS 53

be brought into a space proportionate to the narrative of the Annals by
much omission and abridgement.

The sentences ‘ advenae in nos regnaverunt,⁹ and ‘ Omnia, patres con-
scripti, quae nunc vetustissima creduntur, nova suere: plebeii magistratus
post patricios ' (ξ 1 ι), seem intended to answer to· nearly the whole os the
first column3 the continuatim, ⁸ Latini post plebeios, ceterarum Italiae
gentium post Latinos,' appears to render the sense os the opening words
of the second. The sentences answering to the remainder of this column
are ⁴ num paenitet Balbos ex Hispania² nec minus insignis viros e Gal-lia
Narbonensi transivisse? manent posteri eorum nec amore in hanc
patriam nobis concedunt' (ξ 4), and ‘ ac tamen, si cuncta bella recenseas,
nullum breviore spatio quam adversus Gallos consectum: continua inde
et fida pax’ (ς 9).

The fact that the order of these sentences does not in any way
correspond to that of those in the original speech would show that
Tacitus, in that process of adaptation to his narrative which he describes
by the word ‘invertere '‚² considered himself fully at liberty to rearrange
as well as to condense, and to give the arguments in what seems to him
to be their most appropriate form and order.

The style and expression is thus his own, and the tedious antiquarian
pedantry os Claudius is just sufficiently suggested to make the speech
characteristic without being wearisome.

Our means os judgement are necessarily much limited by our inability
to compare the speeches as a whole; and it is also unfortunate sor
Tacitus that the only instance in which we are thus able to bring him to
book, is one in which such obligations to fidelity as he may have desired
to recognize must have been sorely tried by the literary and rhetorical
desects of his original.

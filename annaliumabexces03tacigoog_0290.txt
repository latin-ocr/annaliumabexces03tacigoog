Vonones (2. 4, 3) and Arsaces son of

the former city, see 2. 56,
'Tigranocerta was founded by Tigranes 1,
with a po lation swept together from
desolated reek cities and from an inva-
sion os Cappadocia (Strab. 11. 14, 15, 5323
12. a, , 539). 1t was soon asterwards
nearly {estroyed by Lucullus (Strab. 1. 1.,
Plut. Luc. 29, 511), and had not recovered
in Strabo‘s time. It was evidently on the
extreme southern frontier os Armenia
(Plin. N. H. 6. 9, 10, 27), and is even
spoken oi* as in Mesopotamia (Strab.

Luc. ²⁴)· Its site is however a vexed
question, and many os the statements os
ancient authors are not to reconcile.
Tacitus, who may probably be following

3, and note.

Corbulo, gives one very definite state-
ment, that it was thirty-seven miles from
Nisibis (15· 5, ο), and places it on the
Nicephorius, described by him as a con-
siderable stream (15. 4, 3), and given by
Pliny (N. H. 6. 27, 31, 129) as a chief
tributary of the u per Tigris; but all
the principal bran es os that river flow
into 11 from the north and at considerably
greater distance from Nisibis than that
specified. Again, the statement of Strabo
(11. 12, 4, 5223 16. 1. 23, 747) that it
lay at the soot of Mt. Masius, in a similar

also 111 those which place it at Diarbekir,
or other sites in that region, the data
furnished by Tacitus and Strabo are
wholly departed from. Others (see the
dissertations of Mommsen and Kiepert in
Hermes ix. 1875, pp. 129—149) had placed
it at Tell-Abad or some other place
within the basin of the Tigris on the
northern side os Masius3 where the dis·
tance from Nisibis answers fairly to that
given above, but the streams seem too
inconsiderable to suit the description os
the Nice horius. More recently, Pro·
sessor Sa nu, travelliug 111 the country in
1879, 1880 (see the summary of his
treatlse ‘ven by Mr. Tozer in ‘ Transac-
tions o the Cambridge Philological
Society', ii. p. 237), found considerable
remains at Tell-Ermen, a little SW. of
Mardin, just thirty-seven miles from
Nisibis, and 011 a river. This site would
agree with all that is said by Strabo and
Tacitus, but would wholly depart from
Pliny’s connexion of the Nicephorius with
the Tigris (see note on 15. 4, 3), and from
his description os the position as on a
height (see above). The Tell-Ermen site
is now adopted b Kiepert in his maps,
cp. Heuderson, ouru. Phil. 28, p. 99
(see that appended to Momms. Hist. v.).

expression here and by the suggestion in
c. 38, 1 of only two alternative causes sor

passage and from the mention os ‘ flagitia

that in the time of these writers, and even,
if Tacitus is to be believed (see Appendix,
p. 575), in the Neronian period, such im-

Christiani Tacitus entirely believes the
charge, and repeats it under other expres·
sions (ὅ 4); but Pliny frankly owns that
such evidence as he could get, even under
torture, went to show a very different rule
os life. The epithet ί malefica ', given to
this ‘superstitio’ in Suet. Ner. 16, may
either be taken as referring generally to
such· misdeeds (cp. 4. 21, 5, δια), or may
have a specific reference (cp. 2. , 5) to
c

the charges of magi frequently rought

against the Christian: (arnold, p. σς. ι,

and 71).

Vite 'us‚ legate of Syria. Some account
of his government is given in Philo,
Leg. 38, and the story of his suicide
in exile is mentioned in Ens. H. E. a, 7.
It has been thought remarkable (see Ap

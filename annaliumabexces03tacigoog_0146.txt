probably the last colleague of Gaius«, Cn. Sentius Saturninus'; while
among younger men of promise was Ti. Plautius Silvanus AelianuS,⁸

subsequent achievements in Moesia.⁴

Even this formidable army did not embark on an expedition beyond
the Ocean without reluctance ⁵ ς and appear8‚ after. embarkation, to have
been driven back by stress of weather‚ but to bave been reassured by a
meteor travelling westward‚ and to have set out again in that direction,
and to have eflected a landing at three places unopposed. From this
point our only narrative, that of Dio, is very vague, and contains many
difficulties! J t states that Caratacus and Togodumnug who had lately
succeeded to the power of their father Cunobelinus, endeavoured to
draw the Romans into morasseS, but were overtaken and successively
defeated; that some part of one of the nations subject to them, the
Boduni 7, made voluntary submission and received a garrison3 that soon
afterwards, at the crossing of an important river, a determined resistance
was offered, and the crossing effected after two days of fighting, in which
Vespasian and Hosidius won· great distinction 3 that from this point the
Britons fell back upon the ThameS, and crossed it at some point within
tidal influence, profiting by their knowledge of the sordable points3 that the
Gaulish auxiliaries swam across after them, and other Roman troops crossed
by a bridge somewhat higher up; but that this advanced force received

on this occasion also.

the Boduni see below: the name ‘ Catu-
vellauni ‘ is found in an inscription (C. 1. L.
vii. 863), and traced in that of the princc
Cassivellaunus of Caesar’s time. lt is
now read by Miiller for Κατυσυχλανοὶ 01

were chiesa. The Boduni therefore formed

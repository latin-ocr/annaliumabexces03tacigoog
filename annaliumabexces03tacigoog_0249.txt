Φ82 CORNELII TACITI ANNALIUM

misericordiam experiretur. frater Cotys», proditor olim, deinde

promissa eius magni penderentur. ad Eunonen convertit, pro- 2
priis odiis non infensum et recens coniuncta nobiscum amicitia

correct designation os the Palus Maeotis.
The genit- ‘ navium ’ resembles ‘ oo-
hortinm' in c. 15, 1, and many others
(Introd. i. v. ς 3² c).

1. Taurorum. This people were
known to Herodotus, who represents
them (4 99, 3) as the inhabitants of the
Crimea. He distinguishes them from
Scythiam proper, and would perhaps
connect them with their predecessors,
the hals-legendary Cimmerians (4. 12, 1).
He also mentions (4. 103, 1) their savage
worship of the Παρθένω. In a wider sense
they were no doubt a Scythia raoe, and
are so called by Strabo (7. 4, 2, p. 308),
who mentions their piratical habits and
hostility to strangers.

auxiliarium, the soldiers of the co-
horts (c. 15, 1). This correction of
Lips. for Med. ‘consiliarium’ has been
generally followed. The old edd. read
‘ consularium ’ς bnt there could have been
noue of such rank in this force (see on
c. 18, 1). Some have followed Rhen. in
reading the correction of an inferior MS„
‘ centurionum ’.

interfectis, aoristic pert: cp. Introd.
i. v. ς 54 b.

4. stater cotys: see c. 15.1. ·

proditor olim. A story is preserved by
the Byzantine writer Petrus Patricius (see
Momms. Hist. v. 379, ας E. T. ii. 46, 1),
that Mithridates (whom he confuses with
the Armenian king of that name) medi-
tated revolt, but, to keep up the appear·
auce of fidelity, sent to Rome his brother
Cotys. who there informed 'nst him,
and received the kingdom as h reward.

5. nemo id auctoritati& This ex-
pression is ἅτ. up„ founded on the analogy

of the Ciceronian ‘id temporis’ (cp. c. 8,
2, and note), ‘id matis* (5. 9, 3). The
Roman commander was only a knight
(⁰⁶6353J123mut, inu-ans„ as in 3. 35, 33

piopriis, ⁴ persoual ⁹. He had only
become his enemy to please the Romans.

7. non infensum. All recent edd.
follow Ryck. and Ern. in thus inserting
the negative, aster MS. Agr. The altema-
tive emendation, ‘ inoffensum ’, s ted
by Jac. Grou. and a proved by advig
(Λᾶν. ii. 551), is hardi'y supported by such
:sm sanandus-02· 3⁸:5¹2:
63 6. 8, 4, διο.) with the Romans, as they
had themselves sought his alliance (c. 15,
a). The adverbial use ol' ⁸ recens ’ is not
found in the minor writings of Tacitus,
nor in Cic. or Caes„ but is otherwise not
uucommou.

8. cultu vultuque. Dr. notice· that

and in historians generally, more common
in Cicero, most of all in Apuleius.

9. genibus . . provolutus: cp. 1 1. 3ο, 1.

11. prole magni Achaemenis. His
great Mithridates (see on
c. 15, 1), is said by Justin (38. 7. 1) ‘pa-
ternos maiores suos a Cyro D “ ue, . . .
maternos a Magno Alexandro et icatore
Seleuco . . . referre ’. Achaemenes is re·
presented as great-grandfather of Cyrus
(Hdt. 7. 11, 3), and founder os the family
of the Achaemenidae‚ to which all the
Persian kings belonged (Id. 1. 125, 5).
Horace uses ‘dives Achaemenes· (od. 2.
12, 21) asauame foratypical Easteru king.

eastern and south· eastern limita, at that
date, of the Parthian power, οι· of the
extent to which this Hyrcanian war had
itself affected it, to be able to say what
safe route from the Persian Gulf to Hyr·
cania then existed. The supposition of
Lips. (approved by Schiller, p. 12 3) that
the C is meant, and that‘ maris
aui· should be read, hardly lessens the
difficulty, as we do not know that the
Romans had any aceess to the Caspian‚
οι· any means of navigating it.

back ιο* at praesidium’, δια, and to mark
a further military success. Dr. follows
the suggestion in Madvig²s‘Adve1saria',
and reads‘ quieti’ (with‘ remeavere ’;)
but such a word would be rather used of
those who remain at home than of those
whose joumey is unobstructed.

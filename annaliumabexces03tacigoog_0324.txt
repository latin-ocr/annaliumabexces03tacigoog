1. artem . . . callebat, &c., ‘ was pro·
finient in the :kin ’ (as distinct srom the
natural gift of Augustus) ⁰ of weighing
out his words,’ so as to say nothing that
could compromise him: cp. ‘argumenta
. . . non tam numerare soleo quam expen-
dere’ (Cic. de Or. 2. 76, 309).

a. tum . . . ambiguus, ‘being besides
full os vigour in the matter of his speech,
or, if obscure, designedly so’ (not from
want of power to speak plainly). On the
speech of Tiberius see 1. 11, 4, and note,
aud his oration (in the form of a letter)
as given by Tacitus in 3. 53-54. Sueto·
nius states (Tib. 70) that he took Corvinus
as his model, but that he spoke best with·
out preparation.

composed ‘ magis inepte quam inelegan-
ter ⁹, a criticism which the only fragment
of his composition preserved to us (that
of his speech given in App. to Β. 11)
would not unfitly illustrate.

5. vividum animuum so ‘vividum
ingenium’ (Lixr. 2. 48, 3). It is to be
noted that Tacitus credits Nero with sus-
ceptibility ancl intelligeuce. On his tastes
here mentioned and their subsequent de-
velopment, the fullest account is found in

Suet. Ner. 20-25, and 52. See also Introd.

7. aliquando, ‘at times! Nipp. notes
that suess is laid on this word, as imply-

passion with him as afterwards (14. 16, 1 ς

instances in which the idea of a restrictive
word, like ‘tantum', is left to be gathcred
from the sense, asc. 55, 3; 14. 33, 3, διο.
Friedl'ander points out (iii. 34¹) the very

write poetry very early in life.

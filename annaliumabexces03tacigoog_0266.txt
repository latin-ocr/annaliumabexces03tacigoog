mentioned. But there appears to be no
evidence inst the su 'tion that they
may have work y Romans soon
after the military occupation of Deva
(see Introd. p. 141) made the district
a ease field for thei‘r enterprisez and the
localit in which the pigs have been
found strongly in favour os this. More-
over the march os Ostorius is described
as b ‘ ‘ him to the neighbourhood οἱ
the fflghannel (ς 3), and would seem
to have passed near enough to the frontier
os the Brigantes to make their disafl'ection
liable to threaten his communications.
Some evidence is also afforded by traces
of the name in the district (see below).
The correct form os the name is however
matter of much controversy. It is given
on the pigs as ‘ DECEA ’‚ DECEANG’,
and (hut see below) ⁸ DECEANGI’g

these letters are not part os the nameg
although on the other hand the lettering
is not so caresul as to warrant the con·
elusion that, where no division is indi-
cated. none ean have been intended.
The analogy os other such inscriptions is

to be abbreviations os adjectival names

evidence of the inscriptions, while leaving
the question open between ‘ de Ceang

and ‘ Deceang , appears really somewhat
in favour of the latter; and sor corrobo-
rating evidence we are referred on the one

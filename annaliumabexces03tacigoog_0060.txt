astonishing ignorance of, or indifference to, the immorality of his wife,³
and the scandalous traffic ⁴ os which the colossal fortunes amassed by
his freedmen was patent evidence, must be held to go sar to bear
out the charge against him. It is probably also in the later period
that the alleged judicial scandals,⁶ so sar as they are well founded,
must be placed; and if the account os the trial of Asiaticus is to be
believed, any other such oeses are probable. The story of his abject
prostration during the crisis of Messalina and Silius must have been
known to many⁸ and cannot well be a fabrication3 and the description
of his state of mind during the intrigues of his subsequent marriage!
though resting, no doubt, on private sources only, derives credit {rom
what was plainly matter of public record, his speech to the praetoriana
emphatically renouncing all idea of matrimony,⁸ the immediate sequence
of a decree to enable him to marry Agrippina,’ and the extraordinary
reasons announced by him for his selection.¹⁰

After this marriage, under the influence of a more imperious will, he
is still further effaced, and appears to originate nothing. He does his
wise’s bidding in all that tends to· advance herself and her son, and·
in destroying the last saseguards that surround BritannicuS.¹¹ He moves
a law, and 'expressly assigns the credit of it to Pallas ; ¹² he proposes a
gift of indemnity, expressly as a boon to his physician Xenophon.²³
Otherwise, his chief function is to condemn and punish,¹⁴ which appears
to have been no uncongenial task to him. For it is his cruelty, far
more than any other quality, that has left an indelible stain upon his
character,¹⁸ and requires as its most lenient explanation the supposition
of such callous apathy as is the natural outcome of imbecility. The
number of his victims is made to reach a sormidable total of all ranks
and classes ; ¹⁸ and we have hideous tales os the levity with which he

enar. ιιι] RULE OF NERO [71]

leadership of Thrasea showed that the extreme sentence of death had
been expected.¹ Even a lower class would be alat-med by the current
belief ⁸ that in the same year the once all-powersul Pallas and another
leading freedman had fallen victims respectively to the emperor's avarice
and animosity.³

Thus all in prominent positione wo'uld feel that they were dristing back
into a similar condition os constraint and jeopardy to that which had
prevailed under former princes, and that while their danger increased, their
saseguards one by one were struck from them.⁴ The death of Burrus,
in which again foul play was commonly believed to have had a share,⁸
took place in the same year which so many events combined to make
ominous; ⁶ and in the same year Seneca, isolated by this loss, and, by
evident decay os influence, marked out for the attacks of those who wished
him ill,⁷ could only avert his danger by a prompt offer to surrender all
his property,⁸ and by a cautious withdrawal from all outward show of
eminence ’; so that· men had no longer to reckon on the influence ot
these trusted counsellom, but on that of Tigellinus and Poppaea.

On minds thus prepared to expect and believe the worst, terrible im-
pression must have been made by the great fire of 817, Aa). 64, and by
the rumours that Nero himself had been its author. From this imputa·
tion, which Tacitus alone of our authorities treats as even open to doubt,¹⁰
the judgement os recent critics has been on the whole disposed to absolve
his memory. The improbability of the motives assigned,¹² his absence
at the outbreak,²² the energetic measures taken by the government sor its
suppression? the bounty shown to the sufferers,¹⁴ weigh considerably

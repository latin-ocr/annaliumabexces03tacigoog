’[34] INTRODUCTION . [cunr. 111

Pliny mentions five ‘municipia’, all of which, he says, owed their status to
Claudius.—P.] The names assumed by towns, as Claudiopolis ¹ (Bithynia
and Cappadocia), Neo-Claudiopolis ¹ (Galatia), ClaudiaPaphos ⁸ (Cyprus),
seem to point to a gift of some favours or privileges which we cannot

belonging to this time, found in various places throughout the Roman world.⁴

On the other hand, we have no evidence of any grants of citizenship by
Claudius, either to communities or individuals on the scale implied in
Seneca’s satire, or even on that adopted by the rival Caesars os the ‘ Year
of the Four Emperors.’ It is consequently probable that Seneca's
diatribes are really directed against a single action os Claudius, which was
at once a striking proofof his liberal views, and excited the liveliest criticism
and even alarin in Roman senatorial society, his concession of senatorial
dignity to some of the chiefs of N ew Gaul ⁸. Claudius’ action was not only
in accordanee with the wise policy of comprehension, which, as he argues,
had made Rome what she was; it was even more closely in agreement
with the policy which Julius, Augustus and Tiberius had consistently
pursued towards the chiess of New Gaul. The main principles of that
policy were that these chiefs should be trusted to the utmost extent com?-
patible with prudence and allied as closely as possible to the house of
the Caesars. They were Roman citizens and Roman knights, and now
they asked for that ‘ right of the broad stripe ⁹ which would open to them
scats in the Roman senate, and Roman magistracies. Their request was
granted, but in the senate and in Roman society, this peacesul invasion of
Rome by the Gauls, at the bidding of an emperor born in Gaul, was as
unpopular as that of England by the Scots under James 1.

This sketch of the general policy at home and abroad, as initiated at
the outset, and in many points consistently maintained throughout,⁸ will
sufficiently support the credit for statesmanship which must be awarded
to Claudius personally or shared by him with advisers ⁷ whom he had at
least the good sense to follow3 and will show how great deduction must
be made from the representations of Roman satirists. Yet the satire is

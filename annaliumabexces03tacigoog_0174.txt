explains the transaction to be that Suil-
lius had lodged a charge against Samius,
and taken this bribe from him to make it
fai13 and had then, by a double treachery,
broken his own corrupt engagement.
Samius, having ascertained this, and
being certain ot ruin, brings the scandal
home to the advocate by committing sui-
cide in his house. ⁸ Praevaricari ⁹, though

Samius had made no corrupt bargain, but
had retained Suillius, by this fec, sor his
defence, and had been betrayed by him.
Suillius, however, as the context shows, is
usually an accuser.

a. consule dancaster cp. c. ²8, 1.
As he never became consul aud is still
called ‘consul desi tus’ aster his death
(Seri. Lud. 13, 4), ipp. supposes that he
must have been designated cos. suff. for
the last two months of the next year.
Mommsen thinks (Staatsr. i. 587, 4) that
Messalina, who hesped distinctions upon
him (c. 12, 4), had procured his designa-
tion sor an ordinary consulship two years
in advance. As consul designate, he
would be asked his opinion first on what-
ever question was brought before the
house (see 3. 22, 6, and note), and evi-
dently takes the opportunity os making

inreverentiam eo prorupisse frementibus vine an aequo cum
patronis iure agerent sententiam eorum consultarent ac ver-
beribus manus ultro intenderent( impulere vel poenam suam

releget? ceteras actiones promiscas et pares esse: tribuendum
aliquod telum quod sperni nequeat. nec grave manu missis per 4
idern obsequium retinendi libertatem per quod adsecuti sint: at 5
criminum manifestos merito ad servitutem retrahi, ut metu coer-

Liv. δια, but the pmticiple appears to be
found only in Tacitus and Ammianus.

a. verberibus, dat. of purpose (ι- ‘ut
verberarent '): ¹ manus intendere ’ is used
of threatening gestures in 4. 3, ², &c.
Compare the account of the conduct οἱ
slaves and freedmen, when protected by
the ⁸ imago Caesaris ’, in 3. 36, 1.

4. conoessum. No express law con·
veying such a power is known, but
Augustus is stated by Dio (56. 13, 7) to
have made iu Am. 4 some ordinanee
respecting the rights (bembus-m) οἱ

trous and others towards freedmen.
ξῙὶῖιὶε power of relegatiou, if, as seems
here implied, it was vested in the patron
himself, without the intervention of a
magistrate, would be a survival of primi-
tive jurisdiction, exercised by atria pote-
stas in families (see a. 50, 4; iv. 7, 4, 5,
δια), and thus over the freedman as part
of the family.

times as that os the jurisdictioni of the
‘praefi urbi’ Dig. 1. 12, 1, 4), but, as a
limit os ban hment, is os older aud

in oram campaniae. It is meant
that those relegated might choose their
own place os residence anywhere not less
than a hundred miles from Rome, and that
the most eligible part of Italy was thus
open to them. Such a relegation was
therefore to be desired rather than dreaded‚
and they would ironically beg sor it.
Statius says (silv. 3. 3, 162) os a freed·

man thus relegated by Domitian: ⁸ hic
mollis Campani litoris oras Et Diomedeas
concedere iussus in arces, Atque hospes,
uon exul erat’

8. retinendi. Tlns gerundtal genit.

and in ¹5· 5, 33 21, 3 (Med.), and is taken
to depeud ou the idea os a substantive

Madvig (Adv. ii. 553) would here insert
‘onus’) so Ritt. ius. ‘munus’): Halm

from good slaves to bad freedmen.

11. Disserebatur eontra. The long
interval makes the want of correspondenoe
between thisand‘quibusdam...fre-

m in 3. 18, a (cited by Nipp.). Cp.

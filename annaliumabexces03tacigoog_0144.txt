CHAP. VT CONQUEST OF BRITAIN [131]

that they plan'ned it on no such paltry scale as that estimated under
Augustus,² but on one really commensurate with the magnitude and
difficulty of the enterprise‚ and more nearly following the actual ex-
perience furnished by the second expedition of Julius Caesar.¹

Four complete legions,⁸ all well known subsequently in British war-
fare‚ were drasted for the service, the ‘Secunda Augusta ⁹ and ‘ Quarta-
decima Gemina Martia ' from Upper Germany, the ‘ Vicesima Valeria
Victrix ’ from Lower Germany, and the ‘ N ona Hispana ’ from Pannonia3
which province also furnished a ‘ vexillatio ' or detachment, probably
from 500 to 1000 strong, from another of its legions, the ‘ Octava
Augusta '.‘ This would give a strength os from 20‚ooo to 25,ooo
legionaries as the nucleus of the army, to which must be added more
than as much again, for the ‘ alae' and ‘ cohortes’ of auxiliary or non·
citizen troops‚⁸ making the whole army probably nearly 60,000.·

The great flotilla collected to transport these troops and to protect
their landing was no doubt the commencement of the ‘ classis Britannica';
which plays a conspicuous part in the campaigns of Agricola,⁷ and
which appears afterwards to have had its principal station at Lymne.

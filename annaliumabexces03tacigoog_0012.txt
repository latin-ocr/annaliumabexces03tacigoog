PREFACE

AT the issue of this new edition of Books XI—XVI
of the Annals it is right to state shortly what hasbeen
done. Furneaux’s edition of the A nnals is historical
and critical, and the revision has been twofold. The
late Professor Pelham undertook, and immediately before
his death completed, the historical revision; the writer
of this preface undertook the critical revision. The
historical revision, which involved the examination of
all the history contained in the introductions 'and notes
to the text, was by far the heavier task. Some passages
in the commentary have been omitted, other passages
corrected. There have also been considerable addi·
tions. The important additions have been bracketed
and initialed. The general result is that the bulk of
the notes is diminished.

With regard to the critical side, the text has been
made to conform to that of the Oxford Classical
Texts, and the notes on the text have been readjusted
accordingly. As on the historica} side, there have been
some omissions and some additionS, and the additionS,
when of any importance, have been bracketed and
initialed.

The purpose of both revisers was to preserve the
broad characteristics of Furneaux’s work; where altera-
tions or suggestions have been made it has been on

the strength of new information.

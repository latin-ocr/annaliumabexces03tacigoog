cnsp, 111] RULE OF NERO

[57]

for a time the title of ‘pater patriae ’ ¹3 ‘ when I shall have deserved it,'
is his answer declining a vote of thanks ’ς other extravagant compliments
are refused ⁸3 nor will he permit his first colleague in the consulship
to swear to his ‘ acta ’ ⁴3 the first honours sor which he makes request
are to the memory os his father, and to the services os his former
guardian.¹⁵ His liberality is shown in magnificent gifts to friends,⁴⁵ in
the donative to the soldiers,⁷ the unusually large congiarium to the
people,⁸ the remission of burdenS‚⁹ also in a subvention, perhaps to
remedy past maladministration, to the public treasury.¹⁰ Above all, he
is to win renown by princely clemency: and speech upon speech are
composed for him,¹¹ set to the strain of the writer's famous treatise ¹¹ ;
while their sincerity is attested by repression of delations,¹³ by acquittals,¹⁴
mitigation or remission of sentences ¹⁸ 3 so that whatever credit was due
in this respect to the age of Augustus, or the first period of Tiberius,
pales before the glory of a prince¹⁸ who exclaims ‘ would that I could
neither read nor write ⁹, when a death-warram lies before him for
signature.¹⁷

The duty devolving on his advisers of framing a public policy‚ which
should favourably impress the Roman world, was at the very outset
called into action by the turn of affairs in the East, as elsewhere
described.¹⁸ It is sufficient here to note that both in vigour of action
and definiteness of purpose, an emphatic contrast was shown to the
weakness and corruption of the previous period ; and that the whispered
misgivings of adverse critics ¹⁹ were not only silenced by the appointment
of Corbulo, but swept away in a torrent of extravagant compliments
awarded by the senate before a blow was struck.²⁰

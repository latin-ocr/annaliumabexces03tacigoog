who might strike out a line of his own when the crisis came.¹ In the
light of what had followed o'n the death of Gaius, none would be so
short-sighted as not to reckon with the praetorians3 but the accession of
the praefect Faenius Rufus, who was quaking under the insinuations of
his colleague TigellinuS,² seemed a tower of strength to them, and the
support of several other important officers of the force, backed by
a liberal donative, might do the rest.⁸ That the last word still would
rest with the armies of Germany and the East, who were little likely to
accept a master whom they had no voice in choosing, was a truth that
perhaps needed to be taught by a later experience.⁴

Tacitus has shown the reality of the plot, against the popular rumour
which discredited it as a fiction ⁸3 and sor all its details he is practically
our sole authority.⁶ Nero and his partisans must indeed have believed
in his destiny‚ when they saw how, after the plot had been kept for two
years secret,'¹ and had even escaped the danger caused by the indiscretion
of Epicharis? it was brought to light the very day before it was to have
been carried into action· 3 how Piso tamely·threw away the one chance
lest to him ¹⁰3 how, when Nero was surrounding himself with soldiers in
his panic‚¹¹ ignorant of the traitors among tbeir ranks,¹’ the baseness with
which they turned upon their associates frustrated another chance of his
destruction,¹⁸ and led them also to the sate they had so justly merited.¹⁴

We have probably to be on our guard throughout against statements
heightened for effect.¹⁸ The contrast of freeborn men, Roman knights,
senatorS, rushing to save themselves by denouncing their dearest friends
and relatives, with the freedwoman who alone defied the rack to conceal
those almost unknown to her, may possibly be overdrawn ¹⁸3 the general

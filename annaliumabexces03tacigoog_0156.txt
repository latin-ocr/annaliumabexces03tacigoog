CHAP. v] coNQUEST OF BRITAIN [143]

It is probable that the successes which marked the first two years' rule

of the distinguished soldier, C. Suetonius Paullnus¹ (81 a, 813, ΑΛ).
59, 60), were gained in the region os North Wales, as we find him
emboldened by them in the following year (814, mn. 61), aster caresul
preparation os means of transport, to carry the Roman arms into its
furthaet recess‚ and by the occupatiori of Mona (Anglesey) at once to
depr-ive the rebels os their sasest refuge,² and to extirpate British Druidism
in its innermost sanctuary. Even veteran soldiers recoiled at first in
panic from the sacred soil; the shores os which, besides bristling with
armed defenders, were lined with the holy men uplisting their hands 'to
heaven in solemn imprecation, and with darlt robed torch-bearing
women, reminding them of the furies os tragic legend. Notwithstanding
these terrors, the landing was soon forced, and the firebrands of the
enemy turned to their own destruction3 the massacre had taken its
course, the altars of human sacrifice had been destroyed, the sacred
groves had fallen before the aire,⁸ when Suetonius was hastily recalled
to face the gravest crisis that had ever threatened Roman rule in Britain.

The great rising of the Britons of the eastern districts⁴ is not only
fully described in the Annals,⁸ but also occupies what is a considerable
proportionate space in the Agricola,⁸ and still more so in the abridge-
ment of Dio! Both authors have duly chronicled the portents by which
the disaster was said to have been heralded⁸; and in Dio we owe further

a description os the personal appearance of the heroine queen; her
commanding stature, stern countenance, flashing eyes, masculine voice,
her abundance of auburn hair floating down to·her hips, her golden torc,
embroidered tunic, and thick cloak clasped over it, as she stands, spear in

hand, to address her countrymen?
The causes os the rising, as given by Tacitus earlier in the Agricola,¹⁰

amount to no more than the general grievances of a proud and sree

the insurrection is striking evidence os the conquest (Agr. 18. 4). The blow struck
rapid growth os Roman influence in so at Druidism appears however to have had

short a time. See Friedl. ii. 66. more anent effecta

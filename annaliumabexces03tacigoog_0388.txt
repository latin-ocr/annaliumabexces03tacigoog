illic habuerant, Sulpicium Camerinum et Pompeium Silvanum
absolvit Caesar, Camerinum adversus privatos et paucos,

1. extra ordinem, without making
these causes await their regular turn in
the list sor trial: . Seu. Ep. 106, 2
⁸ dubitavi utrum di errem te an . . . ius
tibi extra ordinem dicerem ’; also ‘extra-
ordinarius reus’ (Cic. ad Fam. 8. 8, 1).
This rule would appear to have been
intended to ensure a decision of old claims
before fresh ones had accrued.

2. mnitibus, &c Soldiers were liable
to no excise or custom in respect of any·
thi brought from home, or purchased
sor t eir own use, or taken as booty.

3. veno, dative: cp. ‘veno dedisse’
4. 1, 3 (and note). On the traffic carried
on by soldiers see c. 35, 3. lt would
seem that their immunity had hitherto
extended even to this. ⁴ Exercerent ' is
used as ln such expressions as ‘ exercere
Caenus ’.

4. trustra habita, ‘ were evaded ’z cp.
the sense inwhich the phrase is used os
a person in c. 37, 2.

quadragesimae quinquagesimae·
que. Nothing is known of these a} per
cent. and 2 per cent. duties. They were
evidently fictions under which the publi-
cans levied illegal exactions, and therefore
must not be identified with any known
lawful duties under such names. Several
auch fraudulent exactions are mentioned
in Cic. Verr. 3. 49, 1163 78, ¹813 others
in Caes. B. C. 3. 32, but rather as levied
by governors than by publicans.

5. alia. It appears that the right os
distress or ‘ pignoris capio ’ (see on c. 28,
4) had belonged to publicans under the
R ublic (Cic. Verr. 3. 11, 27), but

6. temperata. ‘ was made easier':
c . ‘annonam macelli temperandam ’
( uet. Tib. 34). The facility given must

have consisted in the abolition of dues or ’

other vexatious regulatious, such as are
described in Agr. 19, 4.

7. ne censibus, Ere„ ‘that the ships
οἱ merchants should not be assessed iu
their property, and that they should not

ay property tax upon them. It was no
goubt seen that any tax laid on their ships
was added to the eost of transport.

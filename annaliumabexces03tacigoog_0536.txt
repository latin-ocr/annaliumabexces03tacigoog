Ritt. reads ‘quo. . . et quo’, thinking
that an allusion to the ‘ dies Cremerensis

this would hardly enter into the com-
parison here.

time would be 454 years, reckoned
inclusively3 and Grotefend has shown
(Rhcin. Mus. 1843, p. 153, soll.) that
this would be almost exactly 418 years,
418 months, and 418 days. If the years
are reckoned as 453, 417 os each would
give a nearly correct result.

its arrangements and decorations‚ and
mentions the colossaPstatue 120 feet high
at its vestibule, and ad'ds the remark of
Ner0, ‘se quasi hominem tandem habitare
coepisse) Also Martial,writing when its
place was partly filled by the Colosseum,
and that of the Esquiline portion of the
palace by the Baths of Titus, says (de Sp.
2, 5—8), ⁸ Hic ubi conspicui venerabilis
amphitheatri Erigitur mol'es, stagna
Neronis erant. Hic, nbi-miramur velocia
munera thermas, Abstulerat miseris
tecta superbus ager.' It is added that
‘Claudia diffusas ubi porticus explicat
umbras, Ultima pars aulae deficientis
erat ’. The ‘ porticus Claudia’ stood near
the present chnrch of S. Pietro in Vincoli
(Dyer in D. of Geog. p. 828). Pliny also
tells us of the many works of the painter
Fabullus ⁸ imprisoned' in the palace
(N. H. 35. 10, 37, 120), and of the
temple of Fortune enclosed within its
precincts rd. 3⁶· π, 46, 163). These

Excursus by Brotier (see also Lemaire’s
edition). The building, if it was ever
really completed (see Introd. p. 93, 8),
must have occu ied the

the Palatine an greater part Of

Esquiline, and of the
intermediate valley3 the rest of this space
being filled by the pleasure grounds,
which probably also stretched away to
the agger of ServiuS, and to the site of
the pre-sent railwa station on the
Viminal. This wou d make it include
a vast space of the best and most central
part of the city3 but Signor lanciani⁸s

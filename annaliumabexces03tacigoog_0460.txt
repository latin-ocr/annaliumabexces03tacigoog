1 49. Libertas Thraseae servitium aliorum rupit et, postquam
discessionem consul permiserat, pedibus in sententiam eius iere,
paucis exceptis, in quibus adulatione promptissimus suit A.
Vitellius, optimum quemque iurgio lacessens et respondenti

2 reticens, ut pavida ingenia solent. at consules perficere decretum 5

3 senatus non ausi de consensu scripsere Caesari. ille inter
pudorem et iram cunctatus, postremo rescripsit nulla iniuria
provocatum Antistium gravissimas in principem contumelias
dixisse; earum ultionem a patribus postulatam et pro magni·

4 tudine delicti poenam statui par fuisse. ceterum se, qui severi· ιο
tatem decernentium impediturus suerit, moderationem non
prohibere: statuerent ut vellent, datam et absolvendi licentiam.

5 his atque talibus recitatis et offensione manifesta, non ideo aut
consules mutavere relationem aut Thrasea decessit sententia
ceterive quae probaverant deseruere, parS, ne principem obiecisse ¹5
invidiae viderentur, plures numero tuti, Thrasea sueta firmitudine
animi et ne gloria intercideret.

r. servitium . . . rupit, ‘broke
through the serviliqfi' (a metapbor from
breaking a hond). e same opposition
of ‘genitium' and ‘libertas’ is seen ln
r . 1, 3, &c-

52. discessionem permiserat, ‘al-
lowed the senate to divide.’ It was within
the discretion of the presiding magistrate
to rule whether a ‘ sententis should or
should not be thus submitted to the house.
A well-known instance is seen in the
fnvmafflssmn 31¹3
cessionem facere voluissent . . . arma
cecidissent’3 and others are given in
Momms. Staatsr. iii. 987, s. We see
also from what here follows that they
could refuse to give formal effect to that
which the majority had thus approved,
Only the one consul who presided cn the
day and formally made the ‘ relatio ' is
here mentioned, bnt both are spoken of
below as responsible, inasmuch as they
were joint presidents of the senatorial
court (see 1. 73, 3, δια).

3. Δ. Vitellius, the subsequent em·
petor,l already mentioned in 11. 23, ι. as
consu .

4. respondenti reticens, ‘ holding
his tongue to any who lied to him,
not daring a rejoinder. ' dat. with
‘ reticere ’, not used elsewhere by Tacitus,
is found in Liv. 3. 41, 53 ²5· rs, 93 Ov.

Met· ³, ³57·

5. perficere decretum. This would
imply formal announcement and registra·
tion (cp. 3. 51, 3) of the sentence, with
the names os the senators who signed
it (⁴ scribendo adfuere ’). These sentences

(Momms. Staatsr. ii. 122).

9. pro, ‘in proportion to’ (cp. 3. 2, a,
&c.): for ‘par esse’ cp. 1. 25, 3, διο.

11. impediturus, by his vetor see
above (c. 48, 3).

υ. et - ‘etiam’, ‘they might even

15. ne prinoipem, δια, i.e. lest they
should seem to have rescinded a popular
decision to please Caesar’s vindicaveness.

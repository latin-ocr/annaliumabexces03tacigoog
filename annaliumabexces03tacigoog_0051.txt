popular acts of his successor to remove.⁸

Nor was it only as an inspired judge or legislator, but also among the
conqueror-s of the world, that his own vanity or the language of flatterers

and by claiming the right, so rarely exercised, to extend the ‘ pomerium ’‚⁴
and that he should consider that his own campaign of sixteen days⁶
entitled him to the honour of a full triumph, was perhaps to be expected:
it is more characteristic of the man, that in the space of some twelve
years he should have twenty-seven times ‘received the title of‘ imperator ’⁷
sor victories, many of which seem to desy all attempt at identification‚ ⁸

prodigality with which he showered triumphal distinctions on his sub-'
ordinates.⁰ Other qualities resulting equally from his antecedente were

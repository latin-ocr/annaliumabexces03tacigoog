(Philoffiq. 114) in thinking that the
true read is ⁴ experiens· (‘trying
their fidelity ), and that this word should
come between ‘incertum ’ and ‘ an ’. The
absence of a verb with ‘ nisi quid ’ would
thus be explained as above3 but ‘ex-
periens ' stands in no good contrast to
the following words. Nipp. reads ⁴ in·

he knowled e which it is suggested
that they may ave ossessed would have
been that of the p ot of Nero, not that
οἱ its fnilure, which had only just hap-
pened. The statement of Dio (61. 12, 1)
that Seneca had previously urged the mur·
der seems improbable (see Introd. p. 64).

igitur. Nipp. takes this to refer
to ‘ante ignaros’ (ss read by him) and
to their being thus taken by surprise.
With the reading above given it may
be referred, with Jacob, to ‘ vore
exanimis ’‚ &e. The excitement o Nero
made them hesitate to dissusde him from
the murder, lest it should be useless.
An alternative reason is suggested us

ossible‚ though less likely, in the fol-
owing words.

from openly advocating it. For ⁴ eo

Med„ but inserted from other MSS.

15. 60, 4, and is advocated by Wolfflin
(Philol. 27. 114), who compares ἐς τοσοῦ·

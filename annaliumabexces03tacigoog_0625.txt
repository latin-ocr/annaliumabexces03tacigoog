he was charged, had retii-ed to Asia in

to death there in Α.1). 62 (14. 59, ι).
The difficulty arising from this date is
that it obliges us to suppooe either that
the introduction of the name os Aci-atus
here is an error, or that his actual mis-
sion took place fully two years before
the mention of it (15. 45, 3), and had no
original connexion with the loss of works
of art in the great tire, though it was
perhaps extended aster it.

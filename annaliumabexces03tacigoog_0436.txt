Turpiliano. The former name is so
read by all modern edd. aster Nipp. sor
the Med. ‘ cesonio’ (read in older edd.
‘Caesonio ⁹), on the supposition that he
is identical with the person mentioned

The name is here restored by Lips. from
12. 4ο, 1 for the Med. ‘hanitus’ (Nipp.
omits the praenomen). In Agr. 14, 3

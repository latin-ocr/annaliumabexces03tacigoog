mentioned in the lost portion that he had
died in command of the army of Lower
Germany, and that Corbulo was appointed
to suoceed him·

Corbulo. Cn. Domitius Corbulo, the
famous general so prominent in these
books, was probably son os the person
mentioned in 3. 31, 4 (where see note),
and was hals-brother, on the side oi his
mother Vistilia, to Suillius and Cae-
sonia (see Plin. N. H. 7. 5, 4, 39). He
had been consul in Aa). 39, and is

corrupt Med. text ‘ auxiliare ex diu meri-

rise to many emendations (see Halm and
Baiter, not. crit.). The Bipontine reading
above, adopted by Bach and Halm, is
supported by the description of Tacfarinas
(2. 52, s), which Tacitus seems here to be
nearly repeating3 but other suggestions are
nearer to the MS. text. Most edd. follow

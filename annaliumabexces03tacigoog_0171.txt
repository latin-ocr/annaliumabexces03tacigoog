4 CORNELII TA CI T I A NNALI ΗΜ

[A. D. 47

commemorata vetustate amicitiae utque Antoniam principis
matrem pariter observavissent, dein percursis Asiatici in rem
publicam officiis recentique adversus Britanniam militia,
quaeque alia conciliandae misericordiae videbantur, liberum
5 mortis arbitrium ei permisit3 et secuta sunt* Claudii verba in
eandem clementiam. hortantibus dehinc quibusdam inediam et
lenem exitum, remittere beneficium Asiaticus ait: et usurpatis
quibus insueverat exercitationibus, lauto corpore, hilare epulatum,
cum se honestius calliditate Tiberii vel impetu G. Caesaris peri-
turum dixisset quam quod fraude muliebri et impudico Vitellii
ore caderet, venas exolvit, viso tamen ante rogo iussoque trans-
ferri partem in aliam ne opacitas arborum vapore ignis minuere-
tur: tantum illi securitatis novissimae fuit.

out the injunction of Messalina
(c. 2, 4), Vitellius affects not to notice
the inclination of Claudius to aequit, and,
as if assuming that Asiaticus must be
condemned, leads earnestly, as a friend,
that he shou d be allowed, as an extreme
concessiom to choose his own death (in
Dio, 60. 29, 6, he is even made to say that
Asiaticus had besought him to procure
this boon); and Claudius is then led to
think that by such an indulgence (⁴ cle-
mentia ’) his own romptings to mercy
would be fully satistizd. That any kindly
feeling that be had ever had in the matter
was soon obliterated, is shown by the vin·
dictive mention of Asiaticus a year later
(⁸ Oratio Claudii ⁹, ii. 14), also b the fact

On the case with w ich the feelings of
Claudius were worked upon, cp. 12. 3,

then dead, but her memory was much
honoured (see Introd. 1. ix. p. 146).

3. recenti . . . militia. The part taken
by Asiaticus in the British war is other·
wisc unknown. He is of too high rank
to have been a ‘legatus legionis ’, and was
probably on the personal staff of Claudius

sorge of a genit. oi quality, see Introd. 1.

in eandem clementiam, ‘ to the
same acinus effect’ (ironical). The idea

os s a participle as ⁴ spectantia' may

be taken to be supplied in such uses of
the ‘ in consecutivum ⁹: cp. the closely
parallel ‘ in euffim dpelorem ' (6. 49, 3);
a o 1 . 1, ‚ no .

6. li'oxftaniibus' . . . lenem exitum.
Such a construction is used by Cic. and
others, and resemble: that of παραινεῖν τι.
‘ Inediam et lenem exitum ⁹ arc a hendia-
dys; and the latter expression is a plled
to sels-stawation‚ not as less painfn than
other forms of suicide, but as less violent,
and more resembling a natural death.
Probably from this viem or as more
agreeable to Roman stoicism, it was often
ehosen (cp· 4· 35, 5³ 6· 26, 3. aa). ,

adopting any such views as those given
above, we should have to su pose that
their resistance was provok only by
their disarmament. Such a reference of
‘quod . . . abnuere' to the more remote
clause only is certainly not free from
awkwardness; and this consideration has
given rise to an opposite view, which re-
tains ⁴ Antonam ⁹ ss a possible name of
the Nen, und suppom a line of forts to
-have been drawn along the Severn (with
which the Avon is reckoned) and that
river, so as completely to cut off the
subdued fram the unsubdued country.
-But the identification of ‘ Antona’ with
the Nen is wholly arbitrary, and the use
of ‘castris' as a discrete plural very
doubtfu13 nor can we suppose that the
Romans would have undertaken so pro-
digious a work as the construction of a
line of forts for some 150 miles from the
Severa to the Wash, or that, if they had
done so, it would have been ‘thus cursorily
mentioned. An extremely tempting emen·
dation is that apparently suggested (see
Ritt. 186 >by Heraeus, and sinee strongly
supported by Mr. H. Bradley (Academy,
April 28 aud May 19, 1883), which in-

Trisantonam'. A British river Τρισαντών
is given in Ptol. 2. 3, 4, and though that

coast) cannot ou any probable suppo-
sition be taken to be· here meant, the

with a natural phonetic decay, in the
Tarannon of Montgomeryshire. In this
place Mr. Bradley argues that we discover
ru ⁸ Trisantona· the ancient name of the
Trent, which appears certainly to be
called ⁸ Trannonus’ (or some similar read-
ing) in the ninth century b Nennius (see
Mon. Hist. Brit. p. 77), w o describes as
belonging to a river so named a tidal
pheuomenon which cannot be any other
than the well-known ‘ eagre’ of the
Trent. [The following considerations
-tell strongly iu favour of Mr. Bradley's

emendation. Ostorius was engaged in

rotecting the friendl tribes of Southern

ritain against a s presumably from
the north. With this object he prepared
to brin into subjectiou (⁴ cohibere parat ⁹)
a con derable tract of country. This
proceeding exeited the alarm of the Iceni
ru the east, the Brigantes in the north,
and the Welsh tribes on the west. The
district in uestiou must therefore have
been the idlands‚ and eould be fairly
described as all the country this side of
Trent and Severn, i. e. south of the Trent
and east of the Severn.-P.]

Offerre, the ‘gelegnta Icenorum’ of the

The correct form of the name is seen from
coins to be ‘ Eceni' (probably ‘words-
men ’), and it is thought that their full
name may have been ‘ Eceni ⁶ ⁸, which

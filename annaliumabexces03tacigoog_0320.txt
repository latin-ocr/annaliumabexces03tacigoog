CORNELII TACITI

ANNALIUM AB EXCESSU DIVI AUGUSTI

LIBER XIII

1 1. PRIMA novo principatu mors Iunii Silani proconsulis Asiae

ignaro Nerone per dolum Agrippinae paratur, non quia ingenii
violentia exitium inritaverat, segnis et dominationibus aliis
fastiditus», adeo ut G. Caesar pecudem auream eum appellare

2 solitus sit: verum Agrippina fratri eius L. Silano necem molita 5

ultorem metuebat, crebra vulgi fama anteponendum oese vixdum

notes that generally in such sentences the
indic. is only used when the fact is taken
to be true, though denied to have pro-
duced the result, as ‘non quia poeta α’
(Dial. 9, 3). The use here is parallel to

3. exitium, a correction from MS.
Agr. sor Med. ‘exitum'3 which could
indeed mean death (ι. xo, ο, δια), but

could hardly thus stand quasi-personified
with ‘inritare ⁹. We have thus ‘inritare
plroelium‘ (H. a. 24, 3), ‘bellum’ (San.

4. pecudem auream, ‘ a golden
sheep,’ alluding to his wealth and stu·
pidity. ‘Pecus’ is thus used by Cic.
(eug. in Pis. 9. 19), as we use ‘ beast' or
⁴ brute ’,o of low intellectual or moral cha-
rn'tlrs. This Silanus must have been

younger than Gaius himself ς but his

character may have been already thus
pronounoed. The other M. Silanus, the
father-indaw of Gaius (see on 6. 20, ι),
whom Dio (59. 8, 5) makes to have been
thus characterized by him, would appear
to have been a man of sufficient energy
and position to have been formidable.

indolence, the desire of revenge might

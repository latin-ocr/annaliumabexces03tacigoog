his account of the funeral honours of

Poppaea (c. 6, 3) Tacitus had omitted
this. On the same coins on which the
apotheosis os her child is commemorated
(see on 15. 23, 4), she is also represented
sitting in a temple, with the legend ‘ Diva
Poppaea Aug? (Eckh. vi. 2873 Coh. i.
315). An inscription with the same title
exists (C. 1. L. 11.-1331); and Dio
mentions (63. 26, 5) among the last acts
of Nero his consecrationi of her temple,

26 CORNELII TACI TI ANNALIUM

[Α. D. 47

ad deditionem pellicerent, simul Gannascum dolo adgrederentur.
nec inritae aut degeneres insidiae fuere adversus transfugam et 4
violatorem fidei. sed caede eius motae Chaucorum mentes, et 5
Corbulo semina rebellionis praebebat, ut laeta apud plerosque,

5 ita apud quosdam sinistra sama. cur hostem conciret ? adversa 6
in rem publicam casura: sin prospere egisset, formidolosum paci
virum insignem et ignavo principi praegravem. igitur Claudius 7
adeo novam in Germanias vim prohibuit ut referri praesidia cis
Rhenum iuberet.

¹0 20. Iam castra in hostili solo molienti Corbuloni eae litterae 1
redduntur. ille re subita, quamquam multa simul offunderentur,
metus ex imperatore, contemptio ex barbariS, ludibrium apud
socios, nihil aliud prolocutus q‘uam ‘beatos quondam duces
Romanos: signum receptui dedit. ut tamen miles otium ex· 2

15 ueret, inter Mosam Rhenumque trium et viginti milium spatio
fossam perduxit, qua incerta Oceani vitarentur. insignia tamen 8
triumphi indulsit Caesar, quamvis bellum negavisset.

sentiment here is in unfavourable contrast
with that expressed by the senate of T i·

to ⁴ insignem’‚ and that ‘formidolosum'
(sc. ‘ sore ⁷) is the predicate. The prinee
would be jealons of him, and this would
drive him into rebellion.

8. adeo . . . ut, ‘went so sar in for·
bidding an advanee, as even to order a

bfflns in the ease os Arminius (see 2. 88,
1, and note).

4. semina, used in similar meta hor
in 3. 41, ις 4. 27, ι. The meaning ere
{213²st he so acted as to provoke re-

on.

laeta . . . sinistra fama, best taken
as abl. abs. The epithet ‘laeta’ obliges
us to take ‘ fama’ to mean ⁶ the news of
his doings’ (cp. ‘laeti . . . nuntii* 1. 5,
6); a meaning which it ean also well
bear with ‘ sinistra ' (cp. ‘ sinistra ex urbe
sama ' H. ι. 51, 8), though that os ‘ reputa·
tion ' would otherwise seem more appro-

riate. Med. has ‘insinistra’, whence

itt. thinks that ‘ in urbe sinistra ’ should
be read. The following sentences give
the reasons which led men to think the
news ominous, and cannot be sup
to be those addressed to Clandins; though
the influenoe of the counsel of such per-
sons on him is described in the following
words (‘ igitur Claudius ', &c.).

5. adversa, &c- If there were losses,
they ιζινιοιιὶά fau on the state, not on the
gene .

7. ienavo principi praeca-avem.
N ipp. notes that these words are conpled

withdrawal to this side of the Rhine ², i. e.
a retreat from even the territory which
had already submitted §see Introd. p. 33).
On theusehere ofthep ural ‘Germaniae'

him by surprise! Nipp. notes the expres·

effunderentur. ⁸ were crowding into
his mind'3 so used of a sudden and
terror-striking sight in ι. 68, 5.

12. metus ex: see 1. 29, 3, and note.

13. quondan, a correction of Lips.

1 5. inter HoeamRhenumqne. These
rivers are distinguished in 2. 6, 5. The
canai here mentioned is thought to be the
Vliet (see the discussion in Rup.), leaving
the old Rhine at Leyden and passing by
Delft to the Maas. For similar instanees
of works execnted by soldiers see 13. 53,

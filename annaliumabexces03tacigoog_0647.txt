Α PPENDIX III

stirring up the people against Nero personally, by descn‘bing his ouh-ages
and extravagances at Rome,¹ and as offering the empire² to Galba, who
had then been for eight years legatus of Hispania Tarraconensia and was
a man of the highest family, great serviceS, and enormous wealth.³
Before this offer was made, the rising had already taken formidable

proportionS.

The chief Rhenish tribeS, as the Treveri and Lingones,

held aloof from it‚⁴ as did also the colony of Lugdunum,⁸ the great
capital of the ‘tres Galliae ’ ’ς but Vindex was joined by large numbers
from all parts of Gaul, especially by the richest and most central tribes,
the Arverni, Aedui, and Sequani‚⁷ by the nobility generally? and even by

Rome, bidding them kill even himself,
if he set up to rule over them. The ex·
pres-sion ‘ adsertor a Nerone libertatis’
(used of him in Pl. N. H. πο. 14. 57,
160), on its most natural interpretation,
confirms this view, as does also the
similar profession of allegiance made
at first (Plut. Galb. 5) by Galba (the
titlea ⁸ Hercules adsertor , and ⁸ Mars
adsertor' cited by Mommsen from the
coins issued duriu the rising, are more
ambiguous). On t e other hand the view
of Schiller ( . 261 foll.) and otherS,
adopted also y Mr. Hardy (see note on
Plut. Galb. 4), would take the support
either of the Republic, or of Galba as
emperor, to have been, like the pretended
allegiance of Civilis to Vespasian (H. 4.
13, 2), a mere temporary device to cover
a real design of restoring the independeuce
of Gaul. This view is thought to have
been that taken by Tacitus, on the
strength of several passages in the
Historiesz where the movement is osten
called ‘bellum’ (H. r. 51, ις 65, 4: 89,
1) ς the legions are represented as looking

eneral probability are somewhat
alanced. It is difficult on the one
hand to suppose that so large a force
would have joined Vindex in mere
abhorrenoe of the enormities of Nero’s
personal conduct, or with any expectation
that their tribute or other national
'evancea (see 3. 4ο, 1: H. 4. 17, 33
io, 63. υ, 2) would be remedied by
restoration of the Republic or by a chan
of emperor. It is no less difficult on t e
other hand to imagine the colony of

Vienna, which had enjoyed full Roman
rights for probably nearly thirty years,
and had constantly contributed members
to the Roman senate (see ‘ Oratio Claudii '
ii. 9, and note), joining in any novennem
for Gaulish independeneez and the weak·

rising for that object received two

from Rome. In the absence of clear
knowledge, it is perhaps best to suppo&
that the movement was intended to he

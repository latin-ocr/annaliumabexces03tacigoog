The great event of this year was the invasion of Britain by the Roman
army under A. Plautius SilvanuS‚ who was afterwards joined for sixteen
days by Claudius himself.⁴ It was probably also in this year that the
dissensions between Gotarzes and Vardanes enabled Mithridates, formerly
king of Armenia, to recover that country with the aid of some Roman
troops.⁶ In this year also ⁸ Messalina is stated to have caused the death

of Justus Catonius,⁷ the praef. praetorio (who had intended to give infor-
mation of her immorality), and Julia, the daughter of Drusus and wife of
Rubellius Blandus.⁸

Early in this year Claudius returned from Britain, having been altogether
six months absent from Rome, and celebrated his triumph, which gover-
nors of provinces and even exiles were allowed to return and witness.¹¹
He also held games in honour of his victory.¹¹ His infant son took the
name of Britannicus, and many others received honours and decorations.¹⁸
In the same year ¹⁴ Macedonia and Achaia were given back to the senate ¹⁸3
the quaestorial districts in Italy were abolished‚¹⁸ and quaestors instead of
praetors placed over the aerarium.¹⁷ M. Iulius Cottius received his father's
dominion (the Cottian Alps) with the title of king, and Rhodes was
deprived of its freedom for outrage on Roman citizens,¹¹³ To this year
also belongs the death of King Herodes Agrippa, the partition of his
dominions, and the appointment again of a procurator of Judaea.¹⁹

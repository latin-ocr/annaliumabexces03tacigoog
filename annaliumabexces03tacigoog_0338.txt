lowed Freinsh. in thus correcting the
Med. ‘ ut quidam ' ς the supposition being
that the first syllable of ‘levi ' was lost in
the last os ‘ indolem'‚ and ‘ ui ' corrupted
into ‘ ut ⁹. .

1. quaesivisset=‘acquisivlsset’: the
subjunctive is used, as this is part os
Nero’s thought.

festis Saturno diebus. A similar
expression for the Saturnalia is used in H.
3. 78, 1. Those of the previous Decem-
ber are here meant, the occasion on
which Seneca had produced his ‘ Ludus
de morte Claudii’. The ‘ Saturnalia ’ of
Lucan (anon. vit.) can hardly have been
written quite so early.

So Horace, describing a similar custom,
says (od. 1. 4, 18), ‘nec regna vini sorti-
ere talis.’ From the description 'ven in
Arrian, Diss. Epict. 1. 25, 8, and anian,
Saturn. 4, it appears that the ⁶ kin ‘ might
give any smtastic order to the ο , and
that they were bound to obey.

3. diversa, sc. ‘ iussit', supplied from
the following clause: cp. 3. 56, 3, and
note. On the dat. aster ‘iubeo' see .
72, 2, and note. The construction with
subjunct., as in the next sentence, is found
in H. 2. 46, 2, and in Ter., Liv„ Ov.

5. cantum, διο. Tacitus does not ap·
pes-r to support the story told by Suet.
(Ner. 53), that Nero was jealous of the
vocal powers of Britannicus.

6. convictus ι·- ‘ convivia': cp. 2. 28,
3314. 4, ὃς G. 21, 2.

7. constanter, ⁴ with sels-possession 'z
cp. 3. 6, 4; 6. 22, 4. The poem was
probably not an ‘impromptu ' but a quo·
tation.

evolutum, ‘ turned out of ἐ so used
with ‘integumentis' (Cic. de Or. 2. 86,
3ῗ-ο), and thus figuratively with ‘turba’

that the two conceptions are kept separate:
so ‘ finis sequendi nox et satietas fuit ' (Agr.
37, 6). For instances otherwise explained
cp. 12. 12, 3), and note. ·

10. invidia, ‘ the feeling against him ’ ε
cp. 12. 67, 2, διο. ’

intendit, ‘ increases ἐ cp. 2. 38, 6, διο.

11. nullum crimen, sc. ‘erat' (cp. 6.
43, 1 , and note). Britannicus was liable
to no charge.

12. Pomone Iuno, identified by some
with the Pollio mentioned as praes. praet.
in Plut. oth. 183 but the name there ap-

ars to be an error for Proculus or

lotius.

nam, διο. This refers to ‘parari
venenum iubet' (the words ⁴ ministro . . .
fama' being parenthetical). In such a
household it was easy to get poison ad·
ministered, when once prepared. See the

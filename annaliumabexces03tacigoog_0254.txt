the outer line of his extended pomerium
have been found (Huelsen, Hermes 22,
p. 615), (1) near the Porta Saluta, (2)
near the Piazza sforza-Cesarinl, (3) ou
the E. slope of Monte Testaceio, (4) near
the Porta Metrovia. The position of
no. 3 confirms the statement in Gellius
(13. ¹4) that Claudius brought the
'Aventine within the pomerium. The

bounds of the Roman people, referred το,
was probably not the conquest of Britain,
but some extension of the boundaries of
Italy, possibly the incorporation of the
Anauni near Trent (Bi-uns, Fontes Iur. R.
p. 24o‚ Detlefsen, Hermes 21, p. 544).
According to the authority quoted by
Seneca ide brevit. vit. 13), it was only
the acquisition of Italian territory that
justified the extension of the pomer-imm
but Tacitus, like Vopiscus (vita Aureliani,
21) aster him, may have been unaware of
this technical distinction. No doubt
Claudius' proposed extension had revived
the interest of the curious in the matter,

aud hence Seneca's knowledge-R]

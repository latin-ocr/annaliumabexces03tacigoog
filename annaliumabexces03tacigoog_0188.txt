other two can hardly have been more
than pedantic additions.

2. in aere publico: so used in 12.
53, 5. The first os these letters occurs in
man inscriptions of the time (e. . C. 1.
L. . 921, 1231, 399) and the t ird in
some (e. g. NFMPH1VS); the second is
stated by Priscian (558 P.) to have been
adopted by none, and is generally be·
lieved not to have been foundg but the
form ‘ DI DVRTO ' (‘ Dipsnrto ') appears
to occur in a military diploma (see Leh-
mann, Insc:= 4ο5). No satisfactory restor-
ation os the following words, ‘ dis ple·
biscitis ’, has been made (see Halm, Not.
Criu). Nipp. and Baiter omit boun and
it is suggested by the latter that ‘dis ’ is
an abbreviation of ‘ decretis ⁹, and that
both words are glosses to explain ‘aere
publico ’. lf‘ plebiscitis' is sound, the
term ean only apply to such laws or
rogations (see c. 13, 2) as were passed by
Claudius in virtue oshis tribunician power
(see Momms. Staatsr. ii. 882).

2162), being round in existence shortly
aster this time, and probably as a result
of this motion. On the whole subject of

externae superstitiones- The Egyp-

as also astrology suff magic (cp. 2. 2 ,

that Christianity (see 13. 32, 3, and note)
was already sufficiently prevalent to be.
included in such an allusion.

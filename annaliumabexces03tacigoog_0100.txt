enar. ιιι] RULE or NERO [37]-

Supposing it probable that he occupied Armenia, without opposition from
the Parthians, till the Journey of Tiridates to Rome was accomplished,¹
his tenure of that country would have reached its natural end when that
princc returned invested by Nero with the diadem 3 and, as the ordinary
government of Syria had been for some time in other hands,⁸ no disgrace
would be imfflied in his recall to Rome3 though the existence of some
suspicion or jealousy may be inserted from Nero's having neither taken
the obvious course os transferring him and his legions to the Jewish war,
nor retained him to direct the expedition (probably already in contempla·
tion) beyond the Caucasus3 ⁸ nor could Corbulo himself have sailed to
notice the want of confidenoe in him implied by the appointment of
Vespasian and Mucianus.⁴ His own officer, Arrius Varus, appears to have
been his chief accuser 3 ⁸ and we are allowed to see, even from the
accounts os Tacitus, that there were occasions on which ground of accu-
sation may well have existed! But the suddenness with which Nero
summoned him, and the precautions taken to throw him off his guard,⁷
seem to point to some pressing panic, and lend weight to the suggestion
that his name may have been mixed up, without any complicity on his
own part, in the conspiracy of which his son-in·law Annius Vinicianus is
thought to have been the head.⁸ As to his own unflinching loyalty, re·
pented of only at the last moment of his life, our authority speaks
unhesitatingly.'

It is in the narrative os the final catastrophe that we have above all to ⁰

deplore our loss os the guidance of Tacitus ; by which the many points left
in such great obscurity, respecting the real aim of Vindex, and his relations
with Galba and Verginius, might have been cleared up,¹⁰ and some explana·
tion given of the causes which had led alike the Gallie levies and the German
and Spanish legions, and governors of such various characters and possibly
discordant motives, to agree at least in treating any continuance of the
Neronian rule as impossible.¹¹ It is indeed easy to suppose that such

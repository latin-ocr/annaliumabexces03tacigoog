gnitudo quaestuum spectetur. quod si in nullius mercedem 3

Asinii, Messalae ac recentiorum Arruntii et Aesernini: ad summa

provectos incorrupta vita et facundia.

6). Most recent edd. follow Nipp. in
this correction for the Med. ‘ pulcherrima '
(taken with ‘ praemia’) 3 which would
necessitate ⁸ et being less well taken for
‘ etiam ’. ‘ Foedari ' and the other infini-
tives are not to be taken as following
out the thought of the ‘ veteres oratores ‚
but as depending on the notion of such a
participle as ‘ dicens ’ implied in ⁸ incu-
buit’.

rap-¹2¹3 fidem quidem, δια, i.e. ‘praevari-
catio ’ (c. 5, 2) is more common.

3. necetis agantur. Halm so reads
after Heius. aud Orelli, §nd suggests that

ferior MSS„ ⁸ negotiantur ', a readin
which could easily have been corrupt
from that here given. Nipp., Dr., and
Jacob follow Gron. in reading ‘eant‘g
the verb being taken in the sense of ‘ turn-
ing out ', asin 5. 11, 33 12. 68, 3. Other
readings are ‘ fiant ', ⁴ tueantur ', διο. On
aegaee of ‘in ’ here see Introd. 1. v. ὅ

4. foveri, ‘arenursed '‚ made the most
of: the ‘ fori tabes ’ is litigiousness.

6. Asinii, Messalae. Med. gives ‘Gali
(a correction of ⁴ Gai ') Asinii Messalae ’ς
but it is evident from e. 7, 5, that not
Gallus Asinius (see 1. η, 2, δια), but
his father Pollio, who is known as ‘ in·
signe maestis praesidium reis ' (Hor. Od.
a. 1, ιω, is meant; Walther on the ana-
logy of the following names first suggested
the omission of the praenomen. Most
editors read G. Asinii, and follow Heius.
in adding ‘MR before ‘Messalae’3 the

rson intended being of course M.Valerius

7. proveetoo, sc. ‘esse’, ‘that they
had attained the highest rank '.

8. parabatur autentim the consul
was preparing to give effect to the ex·
pression of feeling thus manifested (cp. c.
5, 3) by making a formal motion on the
subject. In a similar instance later (13.
26, ι), the presiding magistrates do not
venture to do this without consulting the
princeps, but on this occasion Claudius
was present (cp. ‘ circumsistunt Cae·
”oem'fied ⁹), and rlriust have in some way sig·
m approva .

i. e. that all pleaders who took any fees
should be liable to the charge of ‘repe—
tundae ·. The subJect is eas.ly supplied
from the sense.

9. Cossutianus. As only one name is
given, we must su pose that Tacitus had
already spoken o the notorious accuser
Cossutianus Capito, who is prominent in
these Books, After his accusation of
Thrasea and his friends (16. 28, 1 ; 33, 4),
nothing more ia known of him. ¹

aucus. o the penalty (as in 4. 31, 8, διο.)

‘ ante acta' having here the force of
‘ aute actorum am ’. ‘ Facti depre-

decisive settlement ‘of the whole Eastern question, by the recovery of
the captives and standardS, and restoration of Roman supremacy in
Armenia, sacrificed such an opportunity as could never again recur,
and of which a great military genius such as the dictator Caesar would
assuredly have taken advantage. At the same time, the apparent
reasons against such a course are not far to seek. The failure of
Antonius, with a force excellent in numbers and quality, could not
but be an impressive warning to one who could not pretend to equal
his strategic capacity; the army on the spot, eager for dismissal and
reward, and evidently not without mutinous tendencies,¹ could have
been in no humour for one or more campaigns in the pitiless climate
of Armenia,² or for such an expedition beyond the Euphrates as had
been fatal to one, and wellnigh also to the other, of the only Roman
armies which had yet attempted it. At the same time, so sagacious
a politician would readily see that the security of his own position,
as compared with the frequent revolutions of those Eastern dynasties,
would not only protect him from any repetition of the attempt of
Pacorus and Labienus, but would surely sooner or later offer an oppor-
tunity, when a demand, backed even by moderate military force, might
extort compliance from Parthia or Armenia, or from both. Certain it
is, that his speedy reduction of his army to a peace establishment of
eighteen legions,⁸ of which probably only four were stationed in Syria,
and none in any other Asiatic province,⁴ betokened a definite abandonment
of any great military enterprise in that quarter; while the shelter affor-ded
to the fugitive Tiridates, and to the exiled Median king,⁸ showed his
intention to furnish himself with instruments of intrigue.

But Augustus had also to reckon with the force of popular sentiment
at home, which would not allow national disasters to remain indefinitely
unavenged. We may estimate this from the language of Horace, in
whose aspirations during this period⁸ the idea of humiliating the great
Eastern monarchy is very prominent. As soon as the civil wars were

that of establishing along the line of the Upper Euphrates a scientific
frontier, aster the model of those on the Rhine and Danube, guarded by
a sufficient force of legions and auxiliaries. Such a policy was actually

The empty achievement of escorting Tigranes 11 to his kingdom by
Tiberius Nero was soon nullified by the Parthian sympathies of his
family: a repetition of the pageant by Gaius Caesar was attended by
resistance which eost his lise: the attempt os the Roman party to set up

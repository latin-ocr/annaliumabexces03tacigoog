lerat ad studia vulgi. sed nihil arduum videbatur in animoa
principis, cui non iudicium, non odium erat nisi indita et iussa.

British triumph of Claudius in Λ. n.
44, at which date he wouId probably
have been nineteen or twenty years old
(see note above), and had filled no
magistracy: this would be a great de-
parture from ancient practice see 11. 2ο,
5, and note), which Suet. (C . ²4) and
Dio (6ο. 31, 7) exaggerate by saying
that he received the honour in bo hood,

from Dio (l. 1.) that this show was given

7. eane, taken with ‘deeora ’ and
‘ procax ’, concessively, as showing colour
sor the charge. ‘ Procax’, though generally
used in somewhat a bad sense, need not
here mean more than the expression·
(‘ festivissimam omnium puellarum ’) used
of Calvina by Seneca (Lud. 8, 2) ; whose
nigesion to the subject is, however, very
o ure.

that she had been divorced before this
charge was made, such divoroe did not
bar subsequent accusation (see 3. 22, 3);
and it would a pear that Vitellius, as
censor, took up e charge of incest, pro-
fessedly as one affecting his son‘z house·

sented it as the ground of the divoree.

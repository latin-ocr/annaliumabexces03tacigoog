emp, xv] PARTHIA Am> ARMENJA [125]

To recapitulate the phases through which the Armenian question had
in these years passed t—at the outset‚ the offer to recognize Tiridates,
on condition of his acknowledging the kingdom as the gift of Rome,
had been made by the Roman government and rejected by the Parthians ¹:
at a second stage, when Artaxata lay in ashes, Tigranocerta was
occupied by Roman troopS, and Tiridates was a fugitive in Media, the
offer had been cancelled, and Tigranes set on the throne ²3 and aster his

withdrawal there had been at least some professed intention of reducing

the kingdom to a province ⁸: at a third stage, the Parthians had so far
learnt prudence as, even in their hour of victory, to offer in some shape
the homage which they had at first disdained⁴t in the last, the condition
of the personal presence of Tiridates in Rome is insisted on rather to
save Roman honour than as important in itself3 a lame and impotent
conclusion to so severe a, struggle, yet preferable to the only possible
alternative, that of the tenure of Armenia as a province and the permanent
increase of the military establishment by the force required to hold ἰῑ.ις
Tiridates returned to Armenia in 819, run. 66, as its acknowledged
king· 3 and the settlement had at least the merit of permanence. The
only expedition subsequently projected by Nero in the East was in the
Parthian no less than in the Roman interest⁷: the memory of Nero was
held in friendly recollection throughout those regions even after his

31, α). Nero at least took credit for the to secure the entrance into Armenia from
restoration of peace, which he signitied by Sophene. See Mommsen's comments in
closing the temple of Janus (see 16. 28, Hermes, xv. 1880, pp. 289-296.

three years of his absence, Armenia had
been occupied and administered by Cor-
bulo without opposition. Two inscrip-

ple aimed at must have been. as
ffimmsen shows (Hist. v. 394, 1 : E. T.
ii. 62, 1), not the Albani, who lived chiefly,
if not wholly, south of the Caucasus, but
the Alani near the Tanais and Maeotis,
who appear from a confused account in
Jos. Β. 1. 7. 7, 4, to have launched a pre·
datory horde on Media and Armenia at a
time which might coincide with and
account for this expedition. To furnish
forces, the famous 1⁴· ourteenth legion was

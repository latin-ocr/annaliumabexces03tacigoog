⁸ Ignarus ⁹ is used of i orance of the cha-
racterofa person in . 1.49,6 (‘amico·

to be so used here.
munla censoria usurpans in ironi-
cal contrast to the previous wo s). The
most important powers of the censor had
always been vested in the princeps (see
Introd. i. vi. p. 71 foll.); but no actual
eensors had been elected since 732,B. c. 23,
until the office was assumed by Claudius
and Vitellius on laying down the cousul-
shi in this year. The silence of Tacitus
es it probable that this had taken
place before the extant narrative begins.
An inscription (C. 1. L. 9. 53959) styles
Claudius ‘ censor designatus while yet
consul-3 and he is thought to have held
the office for five years; but the evidence
of inscriptions is uncertain, and the oc-
currence ot' the title in a diploma of
December, ΑΛ). 5² (C. I. L. 1⁸, 769), can
hardly be otherwise thau a reference to
his having held that office3 the title being

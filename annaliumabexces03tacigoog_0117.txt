[104] 5- . INTRODUCTJON [ceap. ιν

The narrative of Tacitus ² gives a full⁴ account of the response of
Tiberius to this challenge, and the decisive blows struck by him in
both directione, by instigating the Iber-ian prince Mithridates to seize
Armenia,² and equipping another and again another of the Romanized
Anaeitis, as a leader to the disaffected Parthian nobility.⁸ Yet in all
this his habitual cantion was not lost sight of. His able lieutenant‚
L. vitellius: was charged to avoid actual collision with the Parthians,⁸
and to give Mithridates no other material help than such as consisted
in distracting the enemy by assuming a threatening position on the
Euphrates.⁸ The Armenians themselves would seem to have remained
passive while their country became a battle-ground between the Parthians
and the chief Caucasian nations. Scythian tribes hired themselves out
as allies to both, butwere in' fact present on one side only! The result
showed that the Parthian horsemen were no match outside their own
country sor the more mixed forces⁸ and superior hardihood ⁹ of the
Iberians and Albanians3 who were not only able to defeat the young
prince Orodes,²⁰ but even to gain advantage, by superior local knowledge,
over a levy en masse led by Artabanus himself. ¹² The ·instability of
Eastem thrones is illustrated no less strikingly by the revolution which,
following on these disasters‚ and fomented by Roman intrigue,²² drove
Artabanus into exile and destitution in Scythia,¹⁸ and made the
advance of his rival Tiridates resemble a triumphal procession‚¹⁴ than
by the rapid emmer-revolution which so soon brought the old king
back again, and returned the pretender, as a discrowned fugitive, to
Roman territory.¹⁶ But in all these vicissitudes Mithridates held his
ground; the power-sul Greek city of Seleucia maintained its revolt ²⁰;
and Vitellius was able, just before the death of Tiberius, to compel
Artabanus to make submission and homage, and deliver his son as
a hostage.¹⁷

Whatcver advantage had been gained was soon scattered to the winds
by Gaius, who, on unknown groundS, summoned Mithridates to his

· presence and imprisoned him,²⁸ set up nothing in place of the govern-

ment thus destroyed, and left Artabanus, at the close of his chequered

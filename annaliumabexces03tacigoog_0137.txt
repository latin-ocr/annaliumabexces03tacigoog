and meagre in the extreme. The mention of the route of Lucullus
would point to an advance upon Tigranocerta3 but there is no record
that he ever reached or approached it,¹ and we next hear of him as fas
off from it as Rhandeia: for the intermediate time we have no other
record of this great army than as· striking terror by expelling the
principal supportem of Tiridates, destroying their strongholds, and other
acts of desultory warfare, not greatly exceeding those recorded of Paetus.²
For this startling contrast between the magnificent array of force and
the results achieved by it, it would be unjust to blame the general, who
was no doubt hampered by the instructions of his government, which had
to extricate itself from the difficulty os seeming to accept terms which it
had before rejected by insisting thus absolutely upon investiture at Rome.
Probably by no other means but by the display os irresistible force on
the spot, coupled with the conciliatory messages os Corbulo, could the
Parthians be made to see that this one point of form alone kept them
apart‚⁸ but that, sooner than give up this, Rome was prepared to employ
all the strength of the empire. This point once clearly seen, an under-
standing must have been soon arrived at. Not indeed that Tiridates
conceded nothing, or would without considerable pressure have accepted
a condition which, besides carrying with it a refigious difficulty‚‘ involved
the undertaking of a journey os vast length, at the slow pace necessitated
by the pomp and state suitable to eastern royalty,⁸ the liability at every
stage to what he might consider slights or insults at the hands of Roman
officials,⁸ and, above all, a public scene of submission before the eyes of
assembled Rome⁷3 all of them condescensions to which a king and the
brother of the Great King could not but be deeply sensitive, however he
might feel that the substantial spoils of war were aster all his, and
however truly any. such stately sentence as that with which Tacitus

concludes this narrative might more fitly have become the Parthian than
the Roman motto.⁸

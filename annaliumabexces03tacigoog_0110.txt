In relation to Parthia, sar more than to any other part of the empire,
the dictator Caesar had left to his successors a legacy of war: sor in
this case there was not merely (as in the case of Britain) a sailure to
be redeemed, but the great military disaster of Crassus to be avenged3
and a projected expedition in force had been only frustrated by his
death. The Parthian king, quickened by a sense of his danger, seized
eagerly the opportunity which the dissensions of the two leading trium-
virs soon afforded him,¹⁰ and poured his forces over the frontier, under
the leadership of his son Pacorus and the Roman exile Labienus. This
invasion, in which Decidius Saxa, the legatus of Antonius in Syria,
was ov'erpowered and slain‚ and Syria, Palestine, and nearly the whole
of Asia Minor were lest for nearly two years (713-714, s.c. 41—40)
at the mercy of the invadet, was effectually rolled back in the two
following years (715-716, n.c. 39-38) by the decisive victories of Ven-
tidius BassuS, whereby not only was Roman prestige thoroughly restored,
but a dynastic crisis was brought about in Parthia, resulting in the
deposition and murder of Orodes by his son Phraates.

The Eastern policy of Antonius, which these events and his recon-
ciliation with Octavianus left him sree to prosecute, appears to have

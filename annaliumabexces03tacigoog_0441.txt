1. Tamesae. The name οἱ the Thames
does not occur elsewhere in the extant
works os Tacitus, but was no doubt
mentioned in the narrative os the first
expedition ot* PlautiuS. Med. has here
‘tarn esae’, which the old edd„ before
Pichena, with some inferior Μ88., had
corrupted into‘ notam esse'. The same
form os the name is found in Dio (4ο. 3,
13 60. 20,;5 21‚33 62.,312) inPtol.

form ‘Tamesis' is taken from Caes.

and Dio believed Camu oduuum ιο be ou
the estuary of the Thames, or whether
this term is taken vaguely to include all
from the North Foreland to the tidal
portion of the Colne, then probably
extending to the town (see Introd. p. 142)3
or whether the story made the prodigy
consist in the appearance of such a
reflexion, not where it might naturally
have been seen, but a long way ofl'.

The words of Dio (nal ὅ ὠκεανὸς ὂ μεταξὺ

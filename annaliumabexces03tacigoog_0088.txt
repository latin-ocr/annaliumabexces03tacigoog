cim. ιιι] RULE of· NERO [75]

description of Rome in a state of siege, ‘ the very' sea and river placed
under guard ' 3, armed men pervading the fora, the great houses‚ even the
suburban districts ¹3 the ‘ troops of chained prisoners ’ dragged to trial,⁸
ο and the crowd of funerals in the streets,⁸ cannot easily be reconciled with
the names and facts given in detail ⁴ ε even the terrible irony of universal
public thanksgiving side by side with universal private mourning, may
well be taken with some allowance for rhetoric ⁸ 3 but the main narrative,
both in what it states, and no less in what it does not state‚⁶ bears the
stamp of truth upon it.

Our chief interest in the Pisonian conspiracy lies in its having caused
the deaths of Seneca and Lucan. As regards the complicity of the
sormer,' ‘his standing intimacy· with Piso, and recent withdrawal from .
personal intercourse‚⁸ would suggest that he was aware of the plot but
declined to mix in it 3 his removal from Campania to the neighbourhood
of Rome at the critical time may have been a coincidence ⁹ 3 his alleged
answer to Piso's message rests on the verbal report of a single witness
threatened with torture,¹⁰ and was neither admitted by himself,¹² nor
unmistakable in meaning.¹⁸ His thorough knowledge of Nero,
Poppaea, and Tigellinus may well have predisposed him to welcome any
escape from them 3 while on the other hand his political foresight, no less
than his age, and the retirement of life which he had found so welcome,¹⁸

[148] INTRODUCTJON

most essentia] point, the command os the passage over the ThameS, was
probably srorn this time secured by a permanent bridge, the approach to
which was guarded by a strong ‘castellum ' ¹3 within which met two
great roadS, the Ermine Street leading to Camulodunum and the north,
and the Watling Street, diverted stom its older and unprotected course ²
to one thus placed thoroughly under command. It is probable also that
the approach to the bridge on the southern side was similarly protected.⁸

We may further assume that most, if not all, os the stations already
mentioned as permanent quarters os legions became, as elsewhere in the
empire‚ centres round which a Romanized population grew up.⁴ The
same must have been the case with the seaports through which the com-
merce with the continent may have passed, as Portus Lemanis (Lymne),⁶
Rutupiae (Richborough)‚ Regulbium (Reculver), Dubris (Dover),
Portus Magnus (Porchester)‚ and perhaps Clausentum (Bittern).⁶

² See Mr. Loftie’s map. The fort extends
alon the Thames from the site os Can-
non treet Station ou the west to Mincing
Laue on the east, its north-west angle
being about the oint where London Stone
stands. It wou d appear from the plan
to be of about three quarters of a mile
circuit and hardly 25 acres area. Dr. Guest
has thou ht (see above, p. [134], n. 5)
that this ort dates from the first campaign
of Plautius, but the absence os any allu-
sion to it in ¹4· 33 is against this vievv.
It is also reasonable to suppose that the
sort and the bridge were constructed at
the same time3 and Mr. Lostiejustly argues
that if a permanent bridge had then
existed, Suetonius would never have
abandoned a point of such great strate-
gical importance. That it· began, ῥοῇ·

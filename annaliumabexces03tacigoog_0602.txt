The story is told, with variations, b 5. ictu caleis. The same story is

occurs in the extant portion of the Annals, that his burst of passion was caused by
except the allusion to his frugality (3. 5 5,

the narrative os the campaigns of Plau-

Phoebo. This freedman, otherwise
unnotieed in Tacitus, is mentioned by
Dio (1. l.), who adds that he then hade
Vespasian ἐς κόρακας ἀπελθεῖν, and was
afterwards contemptnously dismissed by
him with the same words, when he came

consumption by fire in 2. 49, 1, and often
in other senses. The word is not found .
before Verg. and Liv.

Romanus mos. Pliny states (N. H.
7. 54, 55, 187) that it was not an old

to apologize to him as emperor. His full
name is 'ven in an inscription (C. 1. L.

2. obtectum. Suet. says (1. 1.) that he
was ‘ prohibitus non contubernio modo
sed etiam publica salutatione ’, and
retired to an obscure place till he was
appointed to the command in Judaea.
The mention of such an interval supporta
the date here given to the offence, rather

(with some edd.) rom ‘condere ’ (cp. H.
5. 5, 5), would here involve a tautology.
This departure from Roman custom may
have been due,as Schiller (p. 200) thinks,
to the affection (or remorae) of Nero.
Friedlaender (i. 451) connects it with her
Jewish predilections, mentioned by Jose-
phus (Ant. 20. 8, 11, διο.); but the Jews
did not really embalm their dead (J oh.

19, 40).

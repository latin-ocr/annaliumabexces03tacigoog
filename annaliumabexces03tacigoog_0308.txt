praevisa = ‘ prius visa? The sense
differs from that in other passages (cp.
c. 4ο, 6, and note), as it here means what
was before their eyes to see, but which
they had not noticed.

1. fertili solo, fecundo mari, abla-
tives ot* quality (Introd. i. v· 2 ): cp.
‘urbem magnifico ornatu' (μὲ, .

4. 62, 3) for the Med. ‘ in meta’. Others,
with Lips„ read ‘ innumera'; Ritt. reads
⁸ in meatu Ponti ’. The words are closely
imitated from what appears to be a state-
ment ot' the same fact m Sall. H. 3. 41 D,
53 Κ, 4ο G (ι qua tempestate ex Ponto vis

accus. can be defended from Verg. Aen.
1. 580 (⁴ erumpere nubem ') and Val. Fl.
5. 466 (‘ nebulamque erumpit ⁹), and from
analogous uses of other verbs (Introd. i. v.
ἦ 12 c). The substance of what is stated
appears mainly to follow Arist. H. A. 8.

‘ thynnus ’. The latter adds that the har-
bour of Byzantium (called Κέρας by Strabo
from the similarity of its ramifications to
those οἱ a stag’s horn) had already in his
time the name οἱ ‘ the Golden Hom ’, from
the wealth thus flowing into it, which
Strabo says was the source, not only of
the prosperity of the city, but also of con·
siderable revenue to Rome. Other notices
os this trade are collected by Prof. Mayor

dauling white colour. The true cause

was probably to be found in the set of the
current; but in modern timss both sides
of the struit are said to abound in fish (see
Orelli’s note).

4. quaestuosi,‘rich'; so used of per·
sons in 13. 35, 3: cp. ‘gens . . . navigi-

5. ‘finem aut modum,² ‘ranission or

that os which the latter part is related
above (c. 1 5-² 1). The addition of ‘ recens’
(on which cp. c. 18, η 2. 21, 1, διο.) is
against referring the Thracian war (with
Orelli) to that of Poppaeus Sabinus
twenty-seven years before (4. 46, fou.):
Nipp. appears to be right in takin it os
some hostilities at the time when hrace
became a province (cp. H. 1, 11, 3);
which according to Eus- Chron. took
place in Α. D. 46 (the error that it did not
take place till the time of Ves asian is
shown in Marq. Staatsv. i. 157, , to rest
on a probabl salse reading in Suet. Vaep.
8, copied in utr. 7. 19).

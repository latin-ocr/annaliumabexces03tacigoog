1. ”natus consultum. This decree
is cited by jurists as the ‘ senatus coa-
sultum Claudianum ', and was an extension
of an earlier ⁶ senatus consultum Silania-
num ⁹, in mn. 1‘03 which is de-
scribed (Dig. ²9· 5) as ordaining that
‘ domino occiso de ea familia quaestio
habenda est quae intra tectum suerit vel
certe extra tectum cum domino eo tem-
{⁰33⁰„0233222‘122ffiff'ss50303233
mentioned3 also as extending the respou-
sibili on the murder os a wife to the
hougeld οἱ the husband and viee versa3
also as ordaining‚ that those who had
been sold in the meantime were to be
reclaimed, and the price made good by the
seller (Dig. 1. 1.. Paul. Rec. Sent. 3. 5, 6).
An instance oi such wholesale execution
of a household is given in 14. 42-44.

4. Lurius Varus. Being a consulas,
he had probably been proconsul os Asia
or Africa, and had been ex lled from
the senate sor extortion- 's had no
doubt been mentioned in its proper place,
so as to make further e lanation here
needless· The name in ed. is ‘ Lurius
Varius ', read iu old edd. as ‘ Lucius
Varius ’ς but ⁸ Lurius ' is a Roman name
(Vell. 2. 85, 2, &c.), and ⁸ Varius· is best
taken (with Nipp.) to be an error οἱ
assimilation.

6 5. p3rouhus: cp. ‘perculit’ (4. 31, 7:
Poinponia Graecina, probably
daughter of Pomponius Graecinus,who was
cos. suntin Am. 16 (see C. 1.L. 6. 10399),
and a friend of Ovid (ex. Ρ. 4. 9, δια).

6. A. Plautio. The name is restored by
Lips. from Med. ‘ piatio ’, the praenomen
added by Nipp., as likely to have been
lost after ‘semina ’; otherwise a single
name would suffice sor a person so well
known to the reader. He was cos. snfl'.

naturally thus refer here to what he must

tulit’ (but reading ‘ ritannis’, with G.,
for Med. ‘ britanniis ³), explaining ⁸ se ret·
tulit ' as asomewhat grandiose expression
for ⁴ rediit' (cp. Verg. G. 4, 1803 Aen. 7,
286, &c.)‚ suited to the rarity at this time
of the honour os an ovation (see Introd.
p. 139, 2). Walther retains also ‘ Britan-
niis' ς but this plural is not according to
the usage os Tacitus, and is hardly to be
defended by its use to denote the islanda
(Plin. N. H. 4. 16, 3ο, 102 . The ovation
oi Plautius took place on is return from
Britain in Α.1). 47 (Dio, 60. 3ο, 2); and
Claudius is stated (Suet. Cl. 24) to have
even paid him the honour of riding in the·
processioa at his side.

7. superstitionis externae. The term
is general (cp. 11. 15, 1), and might well
be used osJudaism or os the Egyptiaure-
ligion; but the belief that Pomponia was
a Christian derives sulpport from the ac·
count os her habits οἱ e (5 4, 5), and still
more from the discovery os Christian in-

was left to her husband, audit was in this

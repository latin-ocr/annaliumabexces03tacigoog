CORNELII TACITI ANNALIUM

[A. D. fio

legiones deducebantur cum tribunis et centurionibus et sui
cuiusque ordinis militibus ut consensu et caritate rem publicam
efficerent, sed ignoti inter se, diversis manipulis, sine rectore,
sine adfectibus mutuis, quasi ex alio genere mortalium repente

acriore ambitu exarserant, princeps composuit, tris qui supra

numerum petebant legioni praeficiendo.

thus raising whole armies at a stroke.
For the political importance of such
bodies see App. Β. C. 2. ι2ο; 3. 8ι.

ι. sni nulnum ordinis ‘os their
own distinct centnry’, i.e. gronped in
their proper centuries. The construction
appears to be that of a genitive of
quality, answ to the abl. os quality
(⁴ diversis manipn is') below. The con-
struction of ‘ snus quisque ', taken as
one word, in the sense of ‘ distinct’ or
⁸ several’, is illustrated by Madvig, on
Cic. de Fin. 5. 17, 46 (‘cni ue partis
. . . sna quaeque vis'), by erence to

6. arbitrio anetus. On the election
of the magistrates of the state by this
body, since the first year of Tiberius, see
1. 15, ι, and note. Their real power of
election would be limited to the filling of
those places in the praetorship (probably
eight? to which no candidates were ‘com-
men ed' by the ' ceps (see 1. 14,6;

tion (Ep. 2. , 5) of his active canvas on
behalf of a 'end.

7. tris, etc. The usual number os
praetors was twelve (1. 14, 6), and there

vvere fifteen candidates. To three of these
he gave the command of legions, and
thus reduced the number of competitas
to that os the vacancies. The office of
⁸ legatus legionis’ might be held before
or aster the praetorship (see 2. 36, 1, and
note); and those now appointed to it
would donbtless be praetors in a subse-
qnent year, and some of those now elected
praetors would become ⁸ leg-ati legionum ’
afterwards.

9. a privauu iudicibus, ‘ from civil
tribunals! We gather that the appeal
from them might lie either to Caesar or
to the senate. Angustus had instituted

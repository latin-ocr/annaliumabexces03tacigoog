by a rapid movement along the Araxes, the complete disappearance o.
Tiridates,¹ and the surrender of Artaxata without a battle.¹

The narrative of the next campaign (14. 23, foll.) is again chiefly
a personal record of Corbulo, of his dealings with the submissive,
the fugitive, the stubborn,⁸ his heroic example in the endurance of
drought and heat, as before in that of piercing cold,⁴ his economy of
Roman lives,‘ his escape from threatened assassination.⁸ Twice only
are we helped, however slightly, by the occurrence of a definite name
in the vague line of march. From the mention of his ‘ passing along
the borders of the Mardi ’,⁷ it is inserted that he had marched from
Artaxata round the foot of Little Ararat to the high plain of Bayazid,
and thence, leaving the basin of the Araxes for that of its tributary
the Balyk‚ over the watershed of that stream and the Murad at Djadin‚
near the foot of the Ala Dagh, and thence along the latter rive
through the plain of Alashgerd or Arishgerd.⁸ The march muz,
have begun late, as we find the army now exposed to the fierce hez
and drought of the short Armenian summer ’ (probably about July
and unable to vary their diet of mere animal food till they reached
a region (perhaps Melazgerd) where the corn was ripe (about August).¹⁶
The locality next given (‘ Tauraunitium ¹) may probably have been the
plain of Mush,¹¹ where they would leave the Murad and strike south-east
for the Bitlis pass, and thence to Tigranocerta, which could hardly have
been reached before September. With its occupation, and the reduction,
after some resistance, of Legerda,¹¹ the campaign may be taken to have
closed.¹⁸

The impression produced by the news of this campaign at Rome
must be gathered from the fact that a complete change of policy
was its result. Tiridates had wholly disappeared from the scene, his
feeble attempt, in the autumn or following spring, to re-enter from

Media, had been so crushed as to leave him without apparent hope

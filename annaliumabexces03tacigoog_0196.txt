The date os his consulship aud that of

his proconsulate os Africa seem unknown.

1. fatale praesagium. Pliny (l. 1.)
makes the ictiou expressly soretell
his death ere, and adds that as he
lauded as proconsul he again saw the
apparitiou, and, being in ill health, gave
up hope oi lise and soon died.

strictness with which udius caused all
male and even female visitors to be
searched, is further noticed by Suet. (Cl.
35) and Dio (6ο. 3, 3). Such recautions
continued till the accession ο Vespasian
(Suet. Ves . ι2; Dio, l. 1.), and appear
to have o ‘ ted in au occasional prac-
tice of Augustus (Suet. Aug. 35).

5. uam, explaining ⁸ neque cognitis

6. ιιοιι infitiatus, Med. has ‘ noni'
with a lacuna of some thirteen letters,
which most have followed Iac. Gron. in
thus filling. Ritt. supposes the words to
have been ‘cuctit cess; ’ (ι cunctanter
cousesms ⁹), taking the sentence to be a
reminisceuce of Liv. 24. 5, ιο (⁰ de se
haud cunctanter fassus conscios celabat ').

7. Isdem oonsulibus: see c. ιι. ι.

P. Dolabella, mentioned as a leading
bnt servile senatorin the time of Tiberius :

see 3. 47, 4. and note. His ‘ sententia ’,
probably expressed ⁴ per egressionem '
(c . note on c. 5, 3), must have been
ta en up by the princeps: whence the
enactment is spoken osas among the ⁸ acta
Claudii’in ι3. 5, 2, and is ascribed to
him in Suet. Cl. 24.

8. qui quaesturam adipiscerentur.
1t appears from ι3. 5, 1, that the ‘ quae-
stores designati ⁹ are meant. Suetonius
(Claud. 24) speaks os this obligation as
imposed on the ‘ collegium quaestorum ',
adding that it took the place of a former
charge on them of the ‘ stratura viarum ’.

9. id. The context shows that a re·
ference iu sense is intended, not only to
the qulaestorship, but to magistracies in

of the use of a ’-partitive genit. with
a word not stri y capable οἱ taking such:

. , . . . . , , ,
and the genit. with ‘omnis' iu Liv. ιο.
3ι, 5; 3ι. 45, 7. The asser-tion that
magistracies were originally open to all
citizens is represented by Livy (di 3, 4) as
put sorward by plebeians ou eir own
account, and would uo doubt be true of
the o ’ al community; distinctions
within e civic body having come in
with admission os new citizens : see
Mommsen, Staatsr. i. 485.

1 ι . ne aetas quidem distinguebatur.
The ⁴ aetas legitima’ sor magistrates was
first fixed by the ‘lex Villia ’, passed by a
tribune in 574 B.C. 180 (Liv. 40. 44, ις
see also Mommsen, Staatsr. i. 529). In
earlier times Valerius Corvus had been
consul at the age οἱ twenty-three (Liv. 7.
26, ι2); and several other instances of
youthsul consuls aregiveu in Cic. Phil. 5.

164 CORNELII TA CITI ANNALIUM [A. D. 54

 

quo bellurn ex commodo pararet, an ut aemulationis suspectos
per nomen obsidum amoveret, tradit nobilissimos ex familia
Arsacidarum. accepitque eos centurio Insteius ab meidio 8
missus, forte prior ea de causa adito rege. quod postquam
5 Corbuloni cognitum est, ire praefectum cohortis Arrium Varum
et reciperare obsides iubet. hinc ortum inter praefectum et 4
centurionem iurgium ne diutius externis spectaculo esset, arbi-
trium rei obsidibus legatisque, qui eos ducebant, permissum.
atque illi recentem gloria et inclinatione quadam etiarn hostium 5

meidio praerepta quae suis consiliis patravisset, testante
contra Corbulone non prius conversum regem ad offerendos
obsides quam ipse dux bello delectus spes eius ad metum
mutaret. Nero quo componeret diversos sic evulgari iussit: ob 7

Some of these were no doubt partisans of
his rival (c. 7, 2).

4. prior ea: so Halm and Nipp.‚
after Muret. and Lips. (⁸ having gone to
the king on that account and having ha

to be first on the spot'), for e
ed. ‘ priore ⁹, which most others retain,
with the meaning that he had gone to the
king on some matter which had pre-
viously occurred. We should rather in
that case have expected ‘ priore aliqua de
eausa’: ‘ea de causa', as read above,
may well be taken to mean that he went
as one of the ‘nuntii' (ᾗ 1); which
seems also implied in ‘ quae suis consiliis
patravisset ’ below.

5. Arrium Varum. robably to be
taken, with Mommsen (filisa v, 392, 13
E. Τ. ii. 60, ι), as identical with the dis·
tinguished offieer of Vespasian. The
objection that the rank of ⁸ primi ilus',
which would naturally precede t of
⁸ praefectus cohortis’‚ is stated in H. 3. 6,
2 to have been conferi-ed on the latter by
Nero at apparently a later date, is met by
pointing out that in C. 1. L. v. 867, a

person who had passed on from ‘ primi-
pilus'of a legion to higher military rank
becomes ⁸ p. iterum ‚ without attach-
ment to a egion, apparently as honorary
rank, to serve as stepping-stone to a ro·
curatorship. Cp. ‘p. p. bis ⁹ (Or. .

9. [recentem cloria: Med. gives ‘ re-
centem gloriam’ and ‘ incssnafinnem', but,
as Andreseu ints out, the ο l hand
has correct ‘gloriam’ to ‘gerla' and
⁴ inclinationem’ to ‘ inclinatione ⁹. This
makes it unneeessary to follow Weissen-
born in reading ‘ recentem gloriam'
or the inferior M . in the insertion of
‘ ob’. It has been objected by some that
‘ recentem gloria ’ (first read by Nip )
is ill suited to the following clause, t it is
difficult to aee the force of the objection.

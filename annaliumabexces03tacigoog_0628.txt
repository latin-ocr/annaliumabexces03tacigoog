⁸ In another rhetorical passage

(r. 42, 3) we have ‘inausum intemera-

eorum gloria. This ma 1ny
be explained (with Gerber andy ree as
taken in a pregnant- sense (a‘eorum
glorioso exemplo ⁹) ; bnt the expression
⁸ gloria alicuius finem petere ' is so strange„
as to make its soundness doubtful.
Madvig suggests (Λᾶν. ii. 558) that a
single stroke hes been misplaced, and
that ⁸ gloriam peteret fine’ (⁴ glorioso fine
iis se aequaret )should be read. Stoicism
inculcated nuder certain circumstances the
duty of suicide, described as εὔλογος ἑξα-
mh (see Diog. Laert. 7. 1, 66) ς and the
tenet was enforced by illustrious examples,
such as that os Cato.

11. 3. 80, 3, as praetor in Α. D. 69, and
in Agr. τι, 1, as having suffered death

Thrasea. According to Suet. (Dom. 10),
who calls him Iunius Rusticus (see 5. 4,
1, and note), the chief offence consisted
in his having spoken οἱ Thrasea and Hel-
vidius as ‘ sanctissimosviros '. Pliny, who
was a friend os his brother Mauricus,

to anticipate its sentence.

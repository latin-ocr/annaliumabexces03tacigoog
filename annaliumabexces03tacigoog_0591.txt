APPENDIX II

It must be admitted that this corroborative evidence is on the whole
slender; but if, as has been already shown,¹ the genuineness os the
passage in Tacitus is· not open to reasonable doubt, we have before us
here an additional illustration of the otherwise apparent fact, that his

works as a whole, especially the Anna18‚ were but little studied.²¹

The

occurrence of a persecution of some kind under Nero is also inde-
pendently confirmed3 but we should certainly have expected it to have
dwelt more in the memory of the Church if the number os sufferers had

solely to it's being the more frequent or'
almost the exclusive place of execution os
all Christians condemned to the arenag
an obligation to send such criminals to
the princeps being recorded (in Aa). 200)
as imposed on governors (Modestinus,
Dig. 48. 19, 31). But there maybe some
reason sor questioning whether many
Christians had been condemned ‘ad
bestias’ in the time of Domitian. The
‘quaestiones de Christianis’ seem not yet

become more stringent in the sace of de⁴

under w ich law (or that os ‘ sacrilegium ')
those refusing to worship the emperor
were arraigned (Tert. Apol. 103 cp«
Neumann, p. 14), had been at some time
thus sharpened: ‘antea in perpetuum

Surge vast shows as those of Trajan, prob-

description,- at the very same date, of 's
own, which seems the usual mode os
procedure, that of order-ing the humbler
culprits to execution there and then, and
sending to Rome only those who could
plead their ‘civitas '. Respecting earlier
times, we are still more in the dark, era
cept that exile had not oeaaed to be the

Tiberius (3. 53, 6), nor apparently in that
of Nero (¹4· 48, 7), though death was often

sor ‘ maiestas’ in the time of some aetion on his

arbitrarily inflicted. Iu favour of the
early prevalence of ⁸ damnatio ad bestiae,
it may be argued‚(1) that the ‘ spectacu-
lum’ given by Nero was likely to have
been in some way imitated ι (a) thur
(putting aside such figurative expressions
as 1 Cor.4‚ 92 a Tim. 4, η) the ἐθφιο·
μάχησα of 1 Cor. 15, 32, isa metnpbor as
regards St. Paul, points to a common
facte (3) that the allusion to Δαναΐδες

καὶ Alpem (see above, p. 423, a) points to
some such spectacle. To these it may

be replied (1) that those so put to death
by Nero were not convicted of ‘ maiestas '
but os alleged incendia-ism, and that the
punishment was r as exceasive
even ior them: (2) at the metaphoric-l
use of θηριομαχεῖν may well have been
sufficiently general to have no special
significance when used by a Christian
(cp. οἵοις θηρίοις μαχόμεθα, Pompeius in
App. B. C. 2. 61): (3) that any explana-
tion of matre, seems impossible, and
the whole reading most questiouable (see
note l. l.). There is also some

counter evidence, (1) in the complete
silence of the Apocalypse itself as to any
such form of martyrdom; (a) still more
in the general designation of the martyrs
as ol τετελειωμένοι (20, 4), pointing to
simple execution as at least the usual
peinktgother suppodtion, perhaps more
probable than that discussed above, is
that Rome, as the seat of governmeut, is
associated with all the righteous blood
shed thro hout the empire. Thia may
be admitt ς but the words seem also to
eontain a more particular reference, οἱ
which thia massacre would be the most
natural explanation.

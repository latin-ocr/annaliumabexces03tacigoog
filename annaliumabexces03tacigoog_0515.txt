CORNELII TACITI ANNALIUM

[A. D· fis

rebus integris scribebat, interrogatus centuri0, qui cum leg-atis
advenerat, quo in statu Armenia esset, omnis inde Romanos
excessisse respondit. tum intellecto barbarum inrisu qui peterent 2
quod eripuerant, consuluit inter primores civitatis Nero bellum
5 anceps an pax inhonesta placeret. nec dubitatum de bello. et s
Corbulo militum atque hostium tot per annos gnarus gerendae
rei praeficitur, ne cuius alterius inscitia rursum peccaretur, quia

Paeti piguerat.

igitur inriti remittuntur, cum donis tamen, 4

unde spes fieret non frustra eadem oraturum Tiridaten, si preces

ι. integris, ‘undecided’z cp. e. 18, 1,
and note. The im . ⁴ scribebat ' seems
to point to some ispatch received from
Paetus at the same time, not to those
which he had previously written ⁴ tamquam
confecto bello ' (c. 8, 3).

3. barbarum: cp. 14· 39, 1‚and note.

qut peterent, διο. This is not strictly
true, for Vologeses treats Armenia as won,
and disdains to ask for it (c. 24, 1).

4. primores civitatis, those who
were the usual counsellors of the princeps.
On the existence of such a (perha per-
manent) pri council under the pire
see Momms. taatar. ii. 903.

5. nee dubitatum de bello. On the

apparently disere ant statement of Dio
see below (on 5 ‘S-
..ἕᾶ ἔῗὶΐὲῗωῗέξνὲξῑῗῖἑῗ ἓξὲἶξὶιξξξ
of ‘praeesse ') in Cic. ro Dom. 9, 20,
and 8compares the use cip ⁸ praeponere ’ in

euius alterius. Nipp. considers that
⁸ alterius ² is here used because only two
persons are compared in thought, Corbulo
and a second, whoever he might be. But
abundant instances are given in Lexicons
to show that ‘ alterius ' commonly serves
as genit. of ‘ alius’.

8. inriti, ‘ baulked of their purpose ἰ
cp. 14. 7, 3, and note.

9. unde apes fieret, Sec. The state·
ment of Dio (62. 22, 3), that Nero dis-
tinctly offered to recognize Tiridates, ou
condition of his coming to Rome to do
homage, is not inconsistent with what is
here said, and is in suu accordance with
the sequel oi events. Tacitus need not
mean more than that the Parthian modi·
fied offer (e. 24, 3) was re'ected.

ιο. executio: so rea for the Med.

‘ excutio ⁹. The use os ‘ executio negotii*
*(Ξιεῗιιιῖἰ Ὶιέιιιίιῗὶειιέοέι. 11, ξιξ Ρξὲέιὶφῖιῗξ
ιι, 4), are somewhat uearer3 and it is
possible that Tacitus may have used
‘executio Suriae’ as a condensed ea·
preasion for ‘executio rerum in Suria
fissffiffii ξὲἐέἕῃῗῖῥῗῖῗὶκῖἲῖἳοῗῑῗὲῗ
as distinct from the command of its forces,
is meant3 whence Madvig (Λᾶν. ii. 557)
thinks that ⁸ executio ' must be altered to
‘iurisdictio’ (cp. 1. 80, 2), and Ritt.
alters ‘Suriaeque ’ to ‘i “ ue'.

C. Cestio: so Halm and others after
Nipp. (⁸ Cestio ' Pich.), for the Med.
‘citio ’, which Orelli formerly took to
represent the name Ὀ. Itio ’ς othersread,
with some MSS„ ‘ Cincio.' ΊἿιο reading
here given is supported by the fact that
C. Cestius Gallus is known to have boeu
legatus of Syria in the autumn of Α. n. 65
(coins of Antioch in Eckh. iii. 282), and
in the following spring (Jos. B. 1. 2. 14, 3),
and to have died there (H. 5. 10, 2). On
his action in that office see Appendix to
Book 16. He is also known to have
been cos. suff„ on the resignation os
Claudius, in April, Α. n. 42 Fasti oi Fer.
Lat. C. Ι. L. vi. 1. 2015),an wasperhaps
son of the cos. of Α.ι>.35 (6. 31, 1 ι cp.
3. 36. 2, and note).

11. quinta decima, one of the Panno-
„infiggggonsoi-Jhaz ”bgggffl’ &named

9
in the Histories, as true to G ba and after·
wards to Otho, and aa allowed by Vitellius
to hold the consulship (Η. 2. 60, 4) to
which he had been designated (H. ι.

CHAP. lv] PARTHIA AND ARMENJA [121]

camp and its stores were to be surrendered, and the river bridged to
enable the vietors to carry off their booty ¹3 and the evacuation itself,
with the insulta attending it,¹ broke down the last remains of disci-
pline, and turned the retreat into a headlong ssight, in which sorty miles
were covered in one day and the wounded abandoned all along the
route *ς until, probably somewhere near Melitene, this wreck of what
had been a Roman army encountered the troops advancing to their
rescue.⁴

Tacitus, if he bas not directIy charged any oi' the blame sor this
catastrophe on Corbulo, has certainly done so by implication, in attributing
his inaction under the first message from Paetus to his desire to win
the glory os appearing as a deliverer in the last eittremity.⁸ What
explanation he may himself have given can be only guessed at; but it
may probably have been that the first message was in no way urgent ’ζ
tbat a force supposed by him to consist os two unbroken legions in
strong winter-quarters should have been able to take care of itself 3 that
in getting ready a force for instant· action) dispatching it on the first
really urgent message, and hastening by forced marches to the spot‚⁸
'he had done all that could reasonably have been expected. Yet it cannot
be denied that his whole attitude during the campaign bad been that
of one who desired not to aid but to increase his colleague's difficulties.

He bad sent to him for the most important service the least efficient ‚

legions ἐ his own elaborate preparatione„ and the forts constructed along
the Euphrates, which betokened, if anything, preparations for an offensive
movement, had only served to convince Vologeses that nothing of the
kind was intended by them,¹⁰ and that he might safely withdraw his army
from their neighbourhood; nor had the obvious course been taken of
turning these advanced posts to account in support of such a demonstra-
tion in soree beyond the river as might have recalled the invaders of
Armenia to protect their threatened communications. His reJ'ection of
the proposal of Paetus, to lead at once the whole force back into
Armeniau (from which Vologeses, apparently in great strait sor forage,¹⁸
had at once retreated), is intelligible enough. The season was too late to

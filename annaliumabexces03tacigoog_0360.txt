[inoffensa . . . amicitia ruit. ‘ Ami-
citia’ is the conjecture of Lipsius, followed
by Nipperdey, for Med. ‘malitia ’. ‘ In-
ofl'ensa amicitia’ is the nominative, like
the pr “ ‘ praecipuae opes’, and the
sentence wi mean that Volusius enjoyed
not only wealth and long life bnt the

to keep Med. ‘ malitia ⁹, and treating it as
an ablative to read ‘ inerunt ' (Halm) ior

mean that Volusius enjoyed wealth and
long life ⁴ without encountering the male·

offensa’ in this sense is ffieult (cp. ‘ Cogit
inoffensae currus accedere metae’, Luc.

There is a third course, to retain 'fuit’
and to take ‘inoffensa (still in the untaci·

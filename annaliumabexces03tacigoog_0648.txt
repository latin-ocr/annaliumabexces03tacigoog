SUMMARY OF EVENTS TILL NERO'S DEATH 481

the Roman colony of Vienna in the N arbonensian province‚· which
appears to have become his head quarters‚¹ and to have carried on a
desultory warfare, embittered by old animosities‚ against its rival Lug-
dunum 3 ⁸ and his force, gathered no doubt srom the militia of the various
cantons,⁸ is given as consisting of roo,ooo ⁴ men.

Galba was already alarmed sor his own security,⁸ and was urged to
action especially by T. Viniu8‚⁸ and apparently, on April 2, so sar
accepted the salutation of his troops as to call himself no longer legatus
of Nero, but general os the senate and peopleJ He was soon afterwards
forced into more decided courses by being declared a public enemy 3 ⁸ but
as he was supported by but one legion,⁹ and the governors of other pro·
vinces who had joined him brought no important accession os strength‚¹⁰
while Vindex was wholly without Roman troops,¹¹ it was plain that all
depended on the action of the German armieS.

Fonteius Capit0, the legatus of Lower Germany‚ was vicious and in-
capable,²² so that the real master os the situation was L. Verginius Rufus‚¹⁸
the legatus of Upper Germany‚ who promptly marched with his own
army and detachments from that of the Lower Province,¹⁴ against
Vesontio (Bezancon), the chief town of the Sequani, which Vindex
hurried to defend.¹‘ The most commonly received account of the
sequel alleges that a conference here took place between the generals,
and that both agreed to declare against Nero,¹⁸ but that the German

⁸ This officer seems then to have been
his legatus legionis; but the expression

Galb. 4) is difficult to interpret (see Mr.
Hardy's note).

death (Jan. 15), and taking the computa-

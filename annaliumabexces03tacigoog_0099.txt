remarkable fact that Corbulo and the two brothers Scribonius Rufus and
Proculus (the legati 01 1113 two ‘ Germaniae ⁹ ) were all in one year put to
death ¹ would show that Nero had conceived suspicion at the same time
01 1113 commandere of all his greatest armies3 but nothing whatever
remains to indicate its ground. Beyond these names, we have no detail 01
1113 many cruelties 01 Nero in Greece 3 ² beyond the name 01 Sulpicius
Camerinus, none respecting those perpetrated by Helius as his vicegerent
at Rome! A few words 01 Suetonius tell us that to the other family
murders were added those 01 1113 adoptive sister Antonia⁴ and 1113 stepson
Rufrius Crispinus; ⁸ a single line 01 Pliny alludes to the 1313 01 1113 six
wealthy possessors 01 11311 1113 province 01 Africa ς’ our accounts 01 1113
13301100 under Galba give us names 01 several delators whose eareers seem
hardly to have begun when the Annals break off. We 313 told that the
Scribonii 1311 before the delation 01 Paccius Africanus ς ‘1 Licinius Crassus⁸
and Salvidienus Orfitus· and their families before that of Aquilius
Regulus ς 11131 Eprius Marcellus had added other noble victims to Thrasea
and his friends ; ¹⁶ that infamy had been incurred on similar grounds by
Vibius Crispus,¹¹ Annius Faustus,¹’ Sariolenus Vocula, Nonius Attianus,
Cestius Severus 3 ¹⁸ and 101 exactions or other misdeeds by the sreedmen‚
as Polyclitus, Vatinius, PatrobiuS‚¹⁴ Petinus‚¹⁸ also by Calvia Crispinilla,¹⁸
and others. When to such indications we add the inference derived
from observing how few 01 1113 cases mentioned in the extant narrative
01 Tacitus would have been known to us without 11,ιτ we 0311 333 how
131 we probably are from being able to form even an approximate
estimate 011113 bloodshed and other acts 01 tyranny 01 1113 1331 two years
01 Ν310.

Among these latest victims our great interest centres in Corbu103 but
as to any explanation 01 1113 1313 we have but conjecture to go upon.

counterbalance and discredit each other.

Our only continuous and consecutive narrative, that of Dio, shrinlts
into the epitome of Xiphilinus at a point a little before that at which
we recover the guidance of Tacitus, and is, unfortunately, somewhat
meagre as a whole in proportion to the general scale of the history¹3
but on many important points, especially on the conquest of Britain,
is our sole detailed authority.

From these source8‚ aided by the miscellaneous ⁴ farrago ’ of Suetonius,

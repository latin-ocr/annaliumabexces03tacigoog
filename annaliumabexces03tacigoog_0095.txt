is vaguely described as ‘ sharing his madness’‚ the second as ‘the
hereditary enemy of princes ', the third as author of ‘' detestable verses ’‚ of
which no further account is given.² That these had followed Thrasea’s
course of abstinence from public lise is nowhere stated; and it must be
inserted that their private and personal connexion with him is the only
real ground of their association in the charge.

We are thus led to suppose that in Nero’s present suspicions mood the
existence os such a coterie seemed in itself to be dangerous. Consider-
able in numbers, and comprising persons of the highest politica] and
social standing,⁸ it lived in isolation3 much as France has seen Legiti-

’ mists, Bonapartists, or Republicans living in an inner world of their own

under a hostile government. With probably no more belief that any
restoration of the Republic was possible, than we have seen it to be likely
that Lucan had,⁸ they yet consecrated their lives to its memory; they kept

governments have found their wisdom in tolerating such bodies, and even
in respecting them; but in the course of terrorism on which Nero was

Other difficulties are raised by the attack on Soranus, which, while
simultaneous‚ and apparently concerted with that on Thrasea,¹¹ comes
from altogether distinct accusers and rests on different charges.²¹ He
had certainly not been always in opposition: fourteen years previously,
he had courted Claudius and Pallas by moving a decree of money and

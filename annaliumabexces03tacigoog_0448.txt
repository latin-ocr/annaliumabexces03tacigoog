est ad reliqua belli perpetranda. auxitque copias Caesar missis
ex Germania duobus legionariorum milibus, octo auxiliarium
cohortibus ac mille equitibus; quorum adventu nonani legionario

frugibus incuriosos, et omni aetate ad bellum versa, dum nostros

pacem inclinabant, quia Iulius classicianus successor Cato
missus et Suetonio discors bonum publicum privatis simultatibus ιο
impediebat disperseratque novum legatum opperiendum esse,

2. 70, 4 (‘nec Piso moratus ultra navis
solvit, moderabaturque cursui ⁹). The
use of ⁶ et ’ with some adversative force is
more common (cp. c. 65, 2; 1. 13, 2,
and note).

9. suooessor Cato: cp. e. 32, 7. The
procurator was apt to be at varianoe with
the legatus (see Agr. 9, 5), and was osten
intended to be a check on him.

7. incuriosos, so used with dative os

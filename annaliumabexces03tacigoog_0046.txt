a chastisement at the beginning of this period from Q. Gabinius Secundus ¹,
were still emboldened six years later to pillage the Gallie coast with small
piratical ships.² This raid was energetically repulsed by Corbulo, who
had also reduced the Frisii to submissim, and was preparing a bold

forward movement which would have carried him even beyond the Weser‚⁸ .

when he was peremptorily ordered to withdraw behind the Rhine, and
to evacuate even what he had already won.

[This withdrawal of the garrisons to the Roman bank was in strict accor-
dance with the policy of Augustus,⁴ and was, as sar as Lower Germany is
concerned, permanent. Roman suzerainty was indeed still recognized by
some of the tribes nearest the Rhine,⁸ and a strip of territory on the right
bank was kept clear of Germans and reserved for the use of the Roman
troops ‘ ; but that the order of Claudius-was carried out is proved by the
absence os any later traces of military occupatiori beyond the Lower Rhine⁷
such as are found along the valley of the Main opposite Mainz.—P.]

With Claudius' principal military achievement, the invasion of Britain,
we deal in a separate chapter?

[Among the taunts levelled at Claudius by Seneca' none is more bitter
than that which charges him with indiscriminate liberality in granting
Roman citizenship. It is however noticeable that this particular charge
is not brought forwa'rd as we should have expected in Nero’s opening
speech, nor is it mentioned by SuetoniuS, and the positive evidence in
support of it is, to say the least, slight.

That Claudius was in favour of a policy of liberal comprehension is
proved by his famous speech.m It is also certain that he gave an impulse
to Roman colonization, and added substantially to the number of Roman
‘ municipia ⁹ in the provinces.

Among his colonies the most famous were Colonia Agrippinensis ¹¹
(Cologne) and Camulodunum ¹¹ (Colchester). To these may be added
Savaria¹⁸ in Pannonia, Apri¹⁴ in Thrace, Aequum¹⁸ in Dalmatia, and
Caesarea and Oppidum Novum in Mauretania.¹⁸ In Noricum the elder
